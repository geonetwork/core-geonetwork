<h1>GeoNetwork opensource - Getting started</h1>

<h2>Running the application</h2>

<p>
  GeoNetwork opensource is a web based Spatial Data Catalog.
  To use it you first have to start the embedded web server.</p>

<p><strong>On Windows</strong>, navigate to the <em>GeoNetwork opensource</em>
  folder in the <em>start-menu</em> that was created during installation and
  <strong>launch "Start server"</strong>. You can then open the GeoNetwork
  application in your browser.
</p>

<p>
  By default this should be at
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/geonetwork">http://localhost:8080/geonetwork</a>
</p>

<p>
  <font color="#FF0000"><strong>IMPORTANT!!</strong></font> After opening
  the GeoNetwork homepage, log on as Administrator.
  You should use the username <font
  color="#FF0000"><code><b>admin</b></code></font> and
  password <font color="#FF0000"><code><b>admin</b></code></font>.
  In the Administration section you can then <strong>modify your
  account</strong>.
</p>

<p>Online documentation is available
  <a href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/docs.html">here</a>.

<p>You can also start the Jetty webserver of GeoNetwork using the scripts
  located into the $INSTALL_PATH/bin directory.</p>

<p>On a Windows platform they are:
  <br>
<ul>
  <li><code>startup.bat</code></li>
  <li><code>shutdown.bat</code></li>
</ul>
On a Linux or OSX platform they are:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>startup.sh</code></li>
  <li><code>shutdown.sh</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Note: A Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    <em>@javaVersion@ Standard Edition</em>
