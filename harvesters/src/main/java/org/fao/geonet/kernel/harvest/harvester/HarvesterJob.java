/**
 * A Quartz job that obtains the Harvester from the JobExecutionContext and executes it.
 * 
 * In Quartz a job is stateless so they can be scaled.  This is not useful for
 * Geonetwork because the harvester needs certain state like ServiceContext.  So instead a job 
 * is submitted to the Scheduler and at the same time a lister is added that listens for that Job.
 * to be executed.  When the Job is to be executed the listener puts the Harvester
 * on the JobExecutionContext.  This Job obtains the harvester from the context and executes it.
