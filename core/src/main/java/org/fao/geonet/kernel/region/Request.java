     * <ul>
     *    <li>
     *        If the request is a category or a specific region ID it can be easily calculated what the last modified date was.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *        The last modified date is known for the entire data set then it can be easily calculated for any request

     *    <li>
     *        If each category could have a different last modified then perhaps only id and category requests can have a last modified
     *        or the most recent last modified of all categories could be the taken
     *    </li>

     * @return Optional.absent() if the search parameters are not applicable to this Region implementation,
     *         {@link Long#MAX_VALUE} if the value cannot be accurately calculated for the parameters set on the search object
     *         otherwise the last modified value of the last modified region that would be in the response if request is executed.
