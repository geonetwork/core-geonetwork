  <gns:description>The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for
    use in resource description. The name "Dublin" is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational
    workshop in Dublin, Ohio; "core" because its elements are broad and generic, usable for
    describing a wide range of resources.
