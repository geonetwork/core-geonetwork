	Describes conversions to other schemas 

		 The name is the name of the converter - used as a service name if a 
		 service is provided to convert records from search results or show (this
		 name should be unique in GeoNetwork so prefixing with xml_<schema_name>
		 is a good idea.

     The xslt attribute is the name of an xslt that does the conversion
		 in the convert dir of the schema
