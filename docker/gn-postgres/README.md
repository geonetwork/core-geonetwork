# GeoNetwork PostgreSQL Test Environment

This composition is meant to make runtime testing the PostgreSQL integration of
GeoNetwork easier.

This folder provides a ``docker-compose.yml`` file for local testing.

These docker images are intended for development and debugging. For production we recommend the official geonetwork docker images at https://github.com/geonetwork/docker-geonetwork.git repository.
