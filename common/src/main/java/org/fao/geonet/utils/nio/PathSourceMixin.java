/**
 * It has been found that for StreamSource (and perhaps InputSource in some cases) both the reader and input stream methods are called
 * to see if they are non-null but only one of them is closed.  This class provides a solution that both
 * {@link org.fao.geonet.utils.nio.PathStreamSource} and {@link org.fao.geonet.utils.nio.PathInputSource} use to fix this problem.
 *
 * There are two obvious solutions to this problem of resource leaks:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Have the close method on both the input stream and the reader close both resources</li>
 *     <li>
 *         If one of the methods is called then return null from the other.  For example if getInputStream is called then getReader
 *         should return null (and vice-versa).  This solution is used in this class because it results in a 50% reduction of
 *         open resources.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
