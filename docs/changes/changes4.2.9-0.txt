- Update Springdoc so that it supports Map objects in the request parameters. By default injectable parameters are excluded from request parameters. Map is one of those object however it does occur where map objects are supplied as parameters and they should be added to open api spec.  There are currently no cases where a map is injected on purpose into the request parameters. This will fix issues with missing request parameters documentation which are based on Map objects.
- Fix spring doc for attachment and keyword to better identify files resources being returned. Update attachment api    "Get a metadata resource" should indicate that gets a file resource    Also "Create a new resource" should identify that it consumes any resources Update keywords api    "Download a thesaurus by name" should indicate that gets a file resource
- Fix springdoc so that enums names are used instead of toString This fixes bug where some apis will not execute correctly from the swagger pager due to the wrong enum value being supplied. i.e. visibility should be using enum values PUBLIC/PRIVATE instead of public/private in formatters/zip api, the format should be SIMPLE/PARTIAL/FULL instead of simple/partial/full
