=== GeoNetwork 2.8.0: List of changes
===
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed increase popularity task
- #1225 TableExport service is prone to SQL injection and allows export any GeoNetwork table
- ported back memory leak fix
- Ensure gmd prefix xslt works for records with prefix and without
- Fix for ticket #1199
- fix resource loading when servlet is not called geonetwork
- SDE harvester validation rules: remove trailing comma causing issues in IE
- #1186 WebDav harvester doesn't keep in synch uuid in database and xml metadata content after reharvest
- Clean up unused options as system configuration was broken
- Fixed few issues with wrong/missing scripts in debug mode. - When in debug mode use the non-compressed version of the 
openlayers - Also added a missing CSW js scripts for debug mode.
- Batch import was not transactional any more - MEFLib/Importer should not control the dbms connection as threads need to 
do that - split out indexing from database because some indexing methods in DataManager commit the dbms
- Fix help text for gmd:protocol in metadata editor
- Make path added to schemaplugin-uri-catalog.xml a uri - fix for ticket #1024
- Fix for reader acquire of a previous version.
- Don't set _title lucene field again - it is already set Don't reset isoLangId - it is already set
- fixed selection with csw
- fixed problem searching by uuid
- Fix for ticket #1088 - thanks to bjohare
- INSPIRE test suite (http://testsuite.gdi-de.org/gdi/) seem not agnostic about namespace prefix for 
http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/common/1.0 and requires inspire_com prefix
- field _title is being added to lucene index document twice
- When calculating default index language allow for case where language element may be present but blank
- Patch to improve lucene search manager and fix too many open files bug
- Comment invalid comparison operators according to INSPIRE
- fixed mapfish print to a specific version (used by georchestra as well
- fix catalog searcher (csw) for spatial searches and paging
- fixed compilation error and use 2 letter char
- fixed geonetwork harvester for harvesting from geonetwork 2.9+ servers (new security)
- Fixed small bug in case where the original local id is lower case. It was being missed in the conversion in gmd:LocalisedCharacterString. 
Applying uppercase conversion fixes the issue.
- Fix for ticket #1169
- remove hit limitting in spatial filters to work around bug in calculating the end hit
- #1053 scripts/ext/locale/* not loading
- Fix for ticket #1159 - move form save into afterHide event on modal box that shows file upload results - otherwise modalbox
gets treated badly by form save and won't come back to life again
- Fix for ticket #1145 - cannot use root element of metadata because sometimes it is not present (eg. when adding a 
gmd:onlineResource element) - also not necessary to have that check because only ever editing 1 record and the record 
is the only xml element in /root with a geonet:info child (other elements in /root are gui and request)
- Another fix related to Ticket #525 Missing POL in the build
- Fix for ticket #1154
- Fix for ticket #1152
- Fix issue where it was not displaying category icons correctly when there were several.
- Only display div for categories if categories exists.  fixes issues in cases where no category exists was messing up the display
- Fix for Ticket #1146 Add missing category icons if the <display-in-search mode="db"/> is on
- Supposed to be the same image as web-client/src/main/resources/apps/images/default/category
- Fix for ticket #1130
- Fix for Ticket #998 typo in local rating
- Fix for Ticket #757 fix typo for term "Gazzetteer" should be "Gazetteer"
- Another related fix for Ticket #1128 Removed extra parameter from call checkForFileUpload as it was no longer required.
- Fix for ticket Ticket #1128 Only show file related error if we are dealing with the "File for download" protocol.
- Fix for 1135, Transaction fails to import if user does not have a group

- Fix #1120.  Error retrieving template during THREDDS fragment harvest due to user session not being present in context 
while running harvest
- #1118 Add xlink:href with CSW link to srv:operatesOn when editing the element in metadata editor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add geoportal REST harvester
- Move schema list and status values list services into xml.info service
- Fix editor metadata section tooltips
- Use MetadataNotFoundEx for consistency
- Add xml-error.xsl for harvesting services to provide XML error responses
- added english translation for requestedlanguagesorted
- added sort language back to ui
- Move 'Clone' into Operation column.
- Enable xml.metadata.schema.add,delete,update services
- Some services need to use MetadataNotFoundEx Add services for xml_services (mainly for xml error handling) Add simple 
Validation service Bug fix in DataManager getMetadataNoInfo NPE Bug fix to add www.opengis.net to iso19139 oasis remap 
error-xml.xml and xml-error.xml doing the same thing - combine
- Switch from status List service to Info service for advanced search menu
- Include xml.schema.list service
- updated config page's multilingual settings so only the correct settings are available
- Added missing script (fi language) for debug mode.
- Allow config overrides on schema conversions files
- #1090 Duplicate key "selectOneFile" in strings.xml
- Move jetty to 7.5.0 for mvn jetty:run
- Add sample config file for jetty to access JNDIPool
- added webspecs submodule
- #1178 New UI - Display default pointer in search results, except for links/actions (display hand pointer)
- #1137 Hovering over "+" symbol in editor displays "Add add"
- updated spring version to 1.5.5 for #1161
- Improve schema selection process in MEFv2 files - use schema from info.xml as suggested by Ian to choose metadata 
to load, if not present then try preferredSchema, if neither present then select first one with valid schema to load.
- Changed regular expression from ^WWW:DOWNLOAD-.*-http--download$ to ^WWW:DOWNLOAD-.*-http--download.* 
So that it would include WWW:DOWNLOAD-.*-http--downloaddata
- Standardized the search for WWW:DOWNLOAD-*-http--download. There were a few variations Used a regular 
expression as it was cleaner.
- Updated MEF load process to generate better debugging messages and better error message so that it would be easier 
to identify where the error is. By better, in this case it meant adding the folder to the error message otherwise it would 
generally only specify "metadata.xml" which is the default filename...
- Set maxWritesInTransaction on spatial database to 1 by default - this is safest as it sets the spatial index writer to 
autocommit thus protecting it from problems when connection to db is lost. Now safe to use as a result of earlier bug fixes.
