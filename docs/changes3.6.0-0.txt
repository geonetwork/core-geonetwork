- WRO4J / Template cache was not used since the introduction of CORSInterceptor. It manipulates the config.url and then the URL is not found in the cache. If the resource is available on the template cache, do not process it in CORS interceptor.
- WRO4J / Template cache is populated on the basis of the name of JS files. It looks for partials folder when a resource folder contains a JS file ending with directive.js. Add Alert to that case.
