## Communication

The [project issue tracker](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/issues) is used for communication, with ongoing topics tagged [documentation](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumenation).

## Material for MkDocs

Documentation is [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) which is a Markdown documentation framework written on top of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

If you are using python3:

1. Install using ``pip3`` and build:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Use ***mkdocs** to preview locally:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
      
3. Preview: http://localhost:8000

   Preview uses a single version, so expect some warnings from version chooser:
   ```
   "GET /versions.json HTTP/1.1" code 404
   ```

4. Optional: Preview online help:
   
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve --config-file help.yml  
   ```

### VirtualEnv

If you use a python virtual environment:

1. Activate virtual environment:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
2. Use ***mkdocs*** to preview from virtual environment:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

3. Preview: http://localhost:8000

### Docker

If you are not familiar with python the mkdocs-material website has instructions for docker:

1. Run mkdocs in Docker environment:

   ```
   docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material
   docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
   ```
   
2. Preview: http://localhost:8000
   
## Publish 2.10.x Archive Docs

We use ``mike`` for publishing (from the `gh-pages` branch). Docs are published by the ``.github/workflows/docs.yml`` automation each time pull-request is merged.

If you wish to preview using your own `gh-pages` branch:

1. To update publish documentation:
   
   ```bash
   mike deploy --push 2.10
   ```

2. To show published versions:

   ```bash
   mike list
   ```

3. To preview things locally (uses your local ``gh-pages`` branch):
   
   ```bash
   mike serve
   ```
