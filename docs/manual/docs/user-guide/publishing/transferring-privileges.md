    -  **Select New Owner**: Select a user in this auto-complete.

    !!! note

        The drop down is filled with all Editors visible to you. If you are not an Administrator, you will view only a subset of all Editors.

    -   **Select group**: Select one of the groups this user is a member of. Privileges to groups All and Intranet are not transferable.

    !!! Note

        Ownership of metadata records can only be transfered to [Workspace Groups](../../administrator-guide/managing-users-and-groups/creating-group.md#1-workspace-group). Other group types will not be shown in the list.
