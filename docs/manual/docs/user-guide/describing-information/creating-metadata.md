# Creating a new record {#creating-metadata}

This topic guides you through the process of adding new metadata records with associated data and/or services into the catalog.

## Before you begin

To add or edit metadata, the user:

-   Must have an `editor` profile or higher.
-   Should be a member of a group you want to add information for.

Contact your administrator if you don't have the correct profile.

1.  From the home page, go to the *contribute* section or directly click on `add new record` menu.

!!! Note

    If only one group is defined in the catalog, and only one template is available, the system settings can be configured to skip the following step and directly open the editor with the selected template and group.

2.  From the metadata template list, select a template (see [Managing templates](managing-templates.md)), choose a group from the group dropdown, configure the creation options in the Create button’s dropdown, and then click Create.

!!! Note

    If only one group is defined in the catalog, the default group is selected.

Next steps:

-   Complete the fields provided by default in the template and probably
-   Create an image of your data to illustrate it in the search results.
