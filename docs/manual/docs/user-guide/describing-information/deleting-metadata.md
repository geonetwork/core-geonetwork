# Deleting a record

The user must have editing privileges to be able to remove a record. This topic describes the various ways to delete a record.

There are different ways to remove a record:

-   In the record view, click the `delete` menu
-   From the search results, select on or more records and select `delete` in the `actions on selection` menu
-   In the `contribute` section click the `delete` button for a record.

!!! note

    If a metadata originates from a harvester, the metadata is automatically removed when the metadata in the harvested system is removed or the harvester itself is removed. The record is re-inserted on the next harvester run.
