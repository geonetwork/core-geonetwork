# Deleting a record

User must have editing privileges to be able to remove a record. This topic describes the various ways to delete a record.

There are different ways to remove a record:

-   From the search results, select on or more records and select `delete` in the `actions on selection` menu
-   In the `contribute` section click the `delete` button for a record.
