# Quick start {#quick_start}

GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources. It provides powerful metadata editing and search functions as well as an interactive web map viewer. It is currently used in numerous Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives across the world.

This Quick Start also describes:

-   some of the different ways you can search for spatial data
-   how to download and display data from the search results

## Starting the catalog

This topic describes how to start GeoNetwork after installation on your machine.

**Before you start:**

Ensure you have successfully installed GeoNetwork using the steps described in `Installing the application`.

To start the catalog:

1.  From your GeoNetwork folder location, open the bin folder and double-click start.bat (on windows) or startup.sh (on linux). This initiates a web service for GeoNetwork, which you can use to view the catalog.

    Tip: If you are using the command line, you can view the log messages directly in the console.

2.  Open a web browser and go to the GeoNetwork homepage. If you installed it on your computer, use this link ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork``.

3.  The GeoNetwork catalog page is displayed.

## Upgrading from GeoNetwork 3 Guidance
   
!!! warning

    Permalink to search page from GeoNetwork 3.x will need to be updated to work with 4.x. 

If you have linked to search results please be advised that some of the URL parameters have changed and you should test and recreate these URLs.

* The catalog services does not provide **permalink** to search results.
* URLs created with ***GeoNetwork 3.x*** search results are not intended to work with ***GeoNetwork 4.x***.

* The use of a new search engine has resulted in changes to the URL parameter names and facets:
  
  Very simple text query:
  
   * GeoNetwork 3: ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?any=road``
   * GeoNetwork 4: ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?any=road``

  The use of a new search engine has resulted in changes to the URL parameter names and facets:
   
   * GeoNetwork 3: ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/searchsrv/eng/catalog.search#/search?resultType=details&sortBy=changeDate&any=road&fast=index&_content_type=json&from=1&to=20``
   * GeoNetwork 4: ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?isTemplate=n&resourceTemporalDateRange=%7B%22range%22:%7B%22resourceTemporalDateRange%22:%7B%22gte%22:null,%22lte%22:null,%22relation%22:%22intersects%22%7D%7D%7D&sortBy=dateStamp&sortOrder=desc&any=road&from=1&to=20``
