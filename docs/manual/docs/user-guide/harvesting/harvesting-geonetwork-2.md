# GeoNetwork 2.0 Harvester {#gn2_harvester}

## Upgrading from GeoNetwork 2.0 Guidance

GeoNetwork 2.1 introduced a new powerful harvesting engine which is not compatible with GeoNetwork version 2.0 based catalogues.

* Harvesting metadata from a v2.0 server requires this harvesting type.
* Old 2.0 servers can still harvest from 2.1 servers
* Due to the fact that GeoNetwork 2.0 is no longer suitable for production use, this harvesting type is deprecated.
