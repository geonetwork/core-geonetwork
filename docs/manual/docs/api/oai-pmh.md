!!! warning

    Unavailable since version 4.0.0.
    
    There is some interest migrating OAI-PMH to Elasticsearch engine used by GeoNetwork 4.
    Interested parties are encouraged to contact the project team for direction on this topic.

The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) standard exposes the metadata records in your catalog in an XML format defined by version 2.0 of the OAI-PMH protocol.

Reference:

* [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html)

## Upgrading from GeoNetwork 3.0 Guidance

The OAI-PMH API is no longer available.

Recommend migrating to use of [Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)](csw.md) API which provides XML document access.
