GeoNetwork 4.2.4 release is a minor release.

## Migration notes

### Database changes

-   If using the pages API, consider checking the `spg_page` database table ([More information](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/7005)) during migration.

### API changes

-   API for link analysis
    -   `POST /links` is now `POST /links/analyze` to analyze all links in a set of records.
    -   `POST /links/analyze` to `POST /links/analyzeurl` to analyze a URL.
    -   `POST /links` allows now queries with large filter which was not supported using GET ([More information](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/7022)).
-   API on pages is now more consistent ([More information](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/6788)). Use `GET pages` to retrieve list of pages (instead of `GET pages/list`). Use `PUT` operation to create a new page or `POST` to upload a file for the page. Section and status can now updated when updating the page. A page label can now be defined. Format, sections and status can now be retrieved using the API.
