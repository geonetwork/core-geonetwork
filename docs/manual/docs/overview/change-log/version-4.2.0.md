# Version 4.2.0 {#version-420}

GeoNetwork 4.2.0 release is a major release.

## Migration instructions

Due to H2 database major update, when migrating from a previous version drop the following database caches:

-   JS/CSS cache database in \$DATA_DIR/wro4j-cache.mv.db
-   Formatter cache database in \$DATA_DIR/data/resources/htmlcache/formatter-cache/info-store.mv.db

If using H2 as the main database consider migrating to an external database (see [Configuring the database](../../install-guide/configuring-database.md)) or read [H2 migration guide](http://www.h2database.com/html/migration-to-v2.html) and migrate the database to version 2 format.

Then start the application.

If using GeoNetwork 4.2.0 with an H2 version 1 database, the following error will be reported by H2 driver:

``` 
General error: "The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.1.212/5]" [50000-212]
```
