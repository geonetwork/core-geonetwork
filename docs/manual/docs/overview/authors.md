GeoNetwork was started in 2001 as project of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-UN), United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

The open-source project was initially managed by Jeroen Ticheler and then donated to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. GeoNetwork [graduated](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/geonetwork-opensource-graduates-osgeo-incubation/) as full Open Source Geospatial project in 2008 and has been managed by a project steering committee and active committers in subsequent years.

## Project Leadership

The GeoNetwork project roadmap is managed using a proposal process, with the GeoNetwork leadership team voting on proposals made by members of our community. This process has moved from mailing list to a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/geonetwork/projects/2).

Active committers to the GeoNetwork project have responsibility for reviewing community contributions to the project,
handling security vulnerability reports, and voting on roadmap proposals:

```

This is primarily an active maintenance role, based on trust given the level of responsibility required. If you are interested in participating please speak up on the developer forum and start by testing and reviewing pull-requests. Nominated committers demonstrate contributions and dedication to the project.

Earning community trust as an committer allows you to merge a pull-request once your review is complete, although this does come with increased leadership responsibility.

We ask that committers remain active, meeting responsibilities to review pull requests, address security vulnerabilities and vote on roadmap proposals. As maintainers we understand that life can get in the way of community particpation – you are welcome to rejoin as your availability permits you to meet the responsibilities.

## Commmitters

GeoNetwork welcomes contributors to take a more active role in the project. If you have capacity please work towards building your comfort level with the code base and express an interest in taking a greater role.

Having commit access is required to volunteer for such activities as making a release.

## Contributors

GeoNetwork uses a pull-request workflow to review and accept changes. Pull-requests must be submitted against the main branch first, and may be back ported as required.

For larger changes we ask that a proposal be submitted to the roadmap for discussion.
