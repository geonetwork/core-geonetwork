## Project Steering Committee (PSC)

The GeoNetwork Project Steering Committee (PSC) makes decisions on GeoNetwork opensource project issues.

In brief the committee votes on proposals on the geonetwork-dev mailinglist. Proposals are available for review for at least two days, and a single veto is sufficient to delay progress though ultimately a majority of members can pass a proposal.
