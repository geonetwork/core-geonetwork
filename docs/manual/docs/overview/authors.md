GeoNetwork was started in 2001 as project of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-UN), United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

The open-source project was initially managed by Jeroen Ticheler and then donated to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. GeoNetwork [graduated](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/geonetwork-opensource-graduates-osgeo-incubation/) as full Open Source Geospatial project in 2008 and has been managed by a project steering committee and active committers in subsequent years.

## Project Leadership

The GeoNetwork project roadmap is managed using a proposal process, with the GeoNetwork leadership team voting on proposals made by members of our community. This process has moved from mailing list to a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/geonetwork/projects/2).

Active developers in GeoNetwork project have taken on responsibility for reviewing community contributions, making releases, handling security vulnerability reports.

This dedication is reflected in community trust, and a Leadership responsibility to vote on roadmap proposals:

## Developer Roles

Developer roles are based on trust given the level of responsibility required. If you are interested in participating please speak up on the developer forum and start by testing and reviewing pull-requests. 

Developers are nominated for a role, self nomination is fine, reflecting ongoing commitment and community trust.

Roles reflect increased project access

| Role  | Responsibility | Trust | Project Access | Roadmap |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| build | build, automations, and release | Low | Access to mange workflows, branches and package releases | Non-voting |
| security | Review security vulnerabilities | High | Security advisories | Non-voting |
| maintainer | Review pull-requests | Highest | Merge pull requests | Voting |

We ask that maintainers remain active, meeting responsibilities to review pull requests, address security vulnerabilities, and vote on roadmap proposals. As maintainers we understand that life can get in the way of community particpation – you are welcome to rejoin as your availability permits you to meet the responsibilities.

GeoNetwork uses a pull-request workflow to review and accept changes. Pull-requests must be submitted against the main branch first, and may be back ported as required.

For larger changes we ask that a proposal be submitted to the roadmap for discussion.
