![](img/standardlist.png)

-   [Geographic information -- Metadata (iso19115-3.2018)](iso19115-3.2018.md)
-   [Geographic information -- Metadata (iso19139:2007) (iso19139)](iso19139.md)
-   [Geographic information -- Methodology for feature cataloguing (Deprecated - use ISO19115-3) (iso19110)](iso19110.md)
-   [Dublin core (dublin-core)](dublin-core.md)

ISO19110 can be used to encode feature catalogue (but ISO19115-3 is recommended).

Dublin core (for CSW only) is only used to test OGC CSW testsuites.

Others standards and community profiles are available on <https://github.com/metadata101>.
