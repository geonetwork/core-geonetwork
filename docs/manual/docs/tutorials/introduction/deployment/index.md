# Deployment {#tuto-introduction-deployment}

On this chapter, we will learn how to make GeoNetwork run on your machine or in the cloud.

Up to version 3 GeoNetwork could easily be deployed locally, there is even a [Windows installer](https://my.geocat.net/download/category/6/GeoNetwork.html). But with the arrival of version 4, GeoNetwork has a number of dependencies that need to be deployed separately, which makes the deployment locally more challenging. Instead the GeoNetwork community provides `es` for automated deployment using Docker. [Docker](https://docker.com) is a virtualisation technology which facilitates deployment of a `on` of prepackaged `es` locally or in the cloud.

For this workshop we will focus on the use of docker, but we also provide some guidance on how to set up the environment without docker, or even build the application from sources.

-   [Build from source code](build.md)
