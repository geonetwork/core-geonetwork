# Setting up search/content statistics {#statistics}

Since GeoNetwork 3.4 search and content statistics are stored in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch/) using [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) dashboards to visualize them in the GeoNetwork administration application.

This guide describes the configuration required to integrate Elasticsearch/Kibana in GeoNetwork to store and visualize the search and content statistics.

GeoNetwork 3.8.x supports Elasticsearch/Kibana 7.2, other versions may not work properly.

!!! note

    This guide doesn't provide a production level setup for Elasticsearch/Kibana. Please refer to the Elasticsearch/Kibana documentation to do a proper setup/configuration for a production environment.
