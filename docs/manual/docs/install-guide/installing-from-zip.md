# Installing using a ZIP file {#installing-from-zip}

For Linux, macOS and Windows users, a zipped GeoNetwork distribution is available that includes the following:

-   GeoNetwork application
-   Jetty servlet container
-   Shell scripts (`.sh`, `.bat`) to start and stop GeoNetwork

Please download the desired ZIP file and extract it to a preferred location on your machine. When done, open the containing folder and navigate to the `bin` folder. This should include 2 `.sh` files that can be used to start and stop GeoNetwork (use the `.bat` files on Windows). Please double-click on the `startup.sh` file to start the server.

In the application root folder, you will find a `readme.html` file that includes some details on how to get started with GeoNetwork. Double-click it to view it in your browser.

Then install the Elasticsearch instance (see [Installing search platform](installing-index.md)).
