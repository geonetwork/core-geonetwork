# Creating group

The administrator can create new groups of users. User groups could correspond to logical units within an organisation, for example `Fisheries`, `Agriculture`, `Land`, `Water`, `Health` and so on.

To create new groups you should be logged on with an account that has administrative privileges.

1.  Select the *Administration* button in the menu. On the Administration page, select *Group management*.

2.  Select *Add a new group*. You may want to remove the *Sample* group;

3.  Fill out the details. The email address will be used to send feedback on data downloads when they occur for resources that are part of the Group.

    !!! warning

        The Name should *NOT* contain spaces! You can use the Localization panel to provide localized names for groups.


4.  Click *Save*

Access privileges can be set per metadata record. You can define privileges on a per Group basis.

Privileges that can be set relate to visibility of the Metadata (*Publish*), data *Download*, *Interactive Map* access and display of the record in the *Featured* section of the home page.

*Editing* defines the groups for which editors can edit the metadata record.

*Notify* defines what Groups are notified when a file managed by GeoNetwork is downloaded.

Below is an example of the privileges management table related to a dataset.
