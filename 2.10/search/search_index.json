You can get the JRE from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads and you have to download the Java 6 Standard Edition (SE). GeoNetwork won't run with Java 1.4. It will run with:</p> <ul> <li>Java 5 - but few people should be using that now as it is unsupported.</li> <li>Java 6 - most testing has taken place under Java 6, so we recommend Java 6.</li> <li>OpenJDK 7 - note: problems have been reported with OpenJDK 6.</li> </ul> <p>Being written in Java, GeoNetwork can run on any platform that supports Java, so it can run on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. For MacOSX, make sure you use version 10.4 (Tiger) or newer. Version 10.3 (Panther) has only Java 1.4 so it cannot run GeoNetwork.</p> <p>Next, you need a servlet container. GeoNetwork comes with an embedded container (Jetty) which is fast and well suited for most applications. If you need a stronger one, you can install Tomcat from the Apache Software Foundation (http://tomcat.apache.org). It provides load balancing, fault tolerance and other production features. If you work for an organisation, it is probable that you already use Tomcat. The tested version is 6.0.x but GeoNetwork should work with all other versions (&gt;= 5.5).</p> <p>Regarding storage, you need a Database Management System (DBMS) like Oracle, MySQL, Postgresql etc. GeoNetwork comes with an embedded DBMS (H2) which is used by default during installation. This DBMS can be used for small or desktop installations of no more than a few thousand metadata records with one or two users. If you have heavier demands then you should use a professional, stand alone DBMS.</p> <p>GeoNetwork does not require a powerful machine. Good performance can be obtained even with 1GB of RAM. The suggested amount is 2GB. For hard disk space, you have to consider the space required for the application itself (about 350 MB) and the space required for data, which can require 50 GB or more. A simple disk of 250 GB should be OK. You also need some space for the search index which is located in <code>GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/index</code> (by default GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR is <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/WEB_INF/data</code>. However, even with a few thousand metadata records, the index is small so usually 500 MB of space is more than enough.</p> <p>The software is run in different ways depending on the servlet container you are using:</p> <ul> <li>Tomcat - GeoNetwork is available as a WAR file which you can put into the Tomcat webapps directory. Tomcat will deploy the WAR file when it is started. You can then use the Tomcat manager web application to stop/start GeoNetwork. You can also use the startup. and shutdown. scripts located in the Tomcat bin directory (.* means .sh or .bat depending on your OS) but if you have other web applications in the tomcat container, then they will also be affected.</li> <li>Jetty - If you use the provided container you can use the scripts in GeoNetwork's bin directory. The scripts are start-geonetwork. and stop-geonetwork. and you must be inside the bin directory to run them. You can use these scripts just after installation.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"developer/development/#tools","title":"Tools","text":"<p>The following tools are required to be installed to setup a development environment for GeoNetwork:</p> <ul> <li>Java - Developing with GeoNetwork requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 or greater (scroll down to find 1.6) OR the OpenJDK (version 7 or higher only) for Linux users.</li> <li>Maven - GeoNetwork uses Maven to manage the build process and the dependencies. Once is installed, you should have the mvn command in your path (on Windows systems, you have to open a shell to check).</li> <li>Git - GeoNetwork source code is stored and versioned in a Git repository on Github. Depending on your operating system a variety of git clients are avalaible. Check in http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis for some alternatives. Good documentation can be found on the git website: http://git-scm.com/documentation and on the Github website https://help.github.com/.</li> <li>Ant - GeoNetwork uses Ant to build the installer. Version 1.6.5 works but any other recent version should be OK. Once installed, you should have the ant command in your path (on Windows systems, you have to open a shell to check).</li> <li>Sphinx - To create the GeoNetwork documentation in a nice format Sphinx is used.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"developer/development/#check-out-source-code","title":"Check out source code","text":"<p>If you just want to quickly get the code the fastest way is to download the zip bundle: https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/zipball/master</p> <p>However, it is recommended that if you want to contribute back to Geonetwork you create a Github account, fork the Geonetwork repository and work on your fork. This is a huge benefit because you can push your changes to your repository as much as you want and when a feature is complete you can make a 'Pull Request'.

Nevertheless, it can be used as an interoperability format between different platforms.</p> <p>This format has been designed with the following needs in mind:</p> <ol> <li>Export a metadata record for backup purposes</li> <li>Import a metadata record from a previous backup</li> <li>Import a metadata record from a different GeoNetwork version to allow a smooth migration from one version to another.</li> <li>Capture metadata plus thumbnails and any data uploaded with the metadata record.</li> </ol> <p>In the paragraphs below, some terms should be intended as follows:</p> <ol> <li>the term actor is used to indicate any system (application, service etc...) that operates on metadata.</li> <li>the term reader will be used to indicate any actor that can import metadata from a MEF file.</li> <li>the term writer will be used to indicate any actor that can generate a MEF file.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"developer/mef/#mef-v1-file-format","title":"MEF v1 file format","text":"<p>A MEF file is simply a ZIP file which contains the following files:</p> <pre><code>Root\n |\n +--- metadata.xml\n +--- info.xml\n +--- public\n |        +---- all public documents and thumbnails\n +--- private\n           +---- all private documents and thumbnails\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>metadata.xml: this file contains the metadata itself, in XML format. The text encoding of the metadata (eg. UTF-8) is specified in the XML declaration.</li> <li>info.xml: this is a special XML file which contains information related to the metadata (metadata about the metadata). Examples of the information in the info.xml file are: creation date, modification date, privileges This information is needed by GeoNetwork.</li> <li>public: this is a directory used to store the metadata thumbnails and other public files.

It must have an info root element with a mandatory version attribute. This attribute must be in the X.Y form, where X represents the major version and Y the minor one. The purpose of this attribute is to allow future changes of this format maintaining compatibility with older readers. The policy behind the version is this:</p> <ol> <li>A change to Y means a minor change. All existing elements in the previous version must be left unchanged: only new elements or attributes may be added. A reader capable of reading version X.Y is also capable of reading version X.Y' with Y'&gt;Y.</li> <li>A change to X means a major change. Usually, a reader of version X.Y is not able to read version X'.Y with X'&gt;X.</li> </ol> <p>The root element must have the following children:</p> <ol> <li>general: a container for general information. It must have the following children:<ul> <li>uuid: this is the universally unique identifier assigned to the metadata and must be a valid UUID. This element is optional and, when omitted, the reader should generate one. A metadata without a UUID can be imported several times into the same system without breaking uniqueness constraints. When missing, the reader should also generate the siteId value.</li> <li>createDate: This date indicates when the metadata was created.</li> <li>changeDate: This date keeps track of the most recent change to the metadata.</li> <li>siteId: This is an UUID that identifies the actor that created the metadata and must be a valid UUID. When the UUID element is missing, this element should be missing too. If present, it will be ignored.</li> <li>siteName: This is a human readable name for the actor that created the metadata. It must be present only if the siteId is present.</li> <li>schema: The name of the schema for the metadata record in metadata.xml. When the MEF is imported by a GeoNetwork actor, this name should be the name of a metadata schema handled by the actor (eg. iso19139). If the GeoNetwork actor does not have such a schema, it may try and select another metadata with a schema that is present (eg. the metadata in metadata-iso19139.xml could be loaded because the iso19139 schema is present).</li> <li>format: Indicates the MEF export format. The element's value must belong to the following set: { simple, partial, full }.</li> <li>localId: This is an optional element. If present, indicates the id used locally by the sourceId actor to store the metadata. Its purpose is just to allow the reuse of the same local id when reimporting a metadata.</li> <li>isTemplate: A boolean field that indicates if this metadata is a template used to create new ones. There is no real distinction between a real metadata and a template but some actors use it to allow fast metadata creation. The value must be: { true, false }.</li> <li>rating: This is an optional element. If present, indicates the users' rating of the metadata ranging from 1 (a bad rating) to 5 (an excellent rating). The special value 0 means that the metadata has not been rated yet. Can be used to sort search results.</li> <li>popularity: Another optional value. If present, indicates the popularity of the metadata. The value must be positive and high values mean high popularity. The criteria used to set the popularity is left to the writer. Its main purpose is to provide a metadata ordering during a search.</li> </ul> </li> <li>categories: a container for categories associated to this metadata. A category is just a name, like 'audio-video' that classifies the metadata to allow an easy search. Each category is specified by a category element which must have a name attribute. This attribute is used to store the category's name. If there are no categories, the categories element will be empty.</li> <li>privileges: a container for privileges associated to this metadata. Privileges are operations that a group (which represents a set of users) can do on a metadata and are specified by a set of group elements. Each one of these, has a mandatory name attribute to store the group's name and a set of operation elements used to store the operations allowed on the metadata. Each operation element must have a name attribute which value must belong to the following set: { view, download, notify, dynamic, featured }. If there are no groups or the actor does not have the concept of group, the privileges element will be empty. A group element without any operation element must be ignored by readers.</li> <li>public: All metadata thumbnails (and any other public file) must be listed here. This container contains a file element for each file. Mandatory attributes of this element are name, which represents the file's name and changeDate, which contains the date of the latest change to the file. The public element is optional but, if present, must contain all the files present in the metadata's public directory and any reader that imports these files must set the latest change date on these using the provided ones. The purpose of this element is to provide more information in the case the MEF format is used for metadata harvesting.</li> <li>private: This element has the same purpose and structure of the public element but is related to maps and all other private files.</li> </ol> <p>Any other element or attribute should be ignored by readers that don't understand them.

Attributes - Find one or more attributes and/or namespaces in the document. An example use case is a profile of ISO19115/19139 that adds optional elements under a new namespace to gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification. To detect records that belong to this profile the autodetect section in the schema-ident.xml file could look something like the following:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect xmlns:cmar=\"http://www.marine.csiro.au/schemas/cmar.xsd\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- catch all cmar records that have the cmar vocab element --&gt;\n    &lt;attributes cmar:vocab=\"http://www.marine.csiro.au/vocabs/projectCodes.xml\"/&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Some other points about attributes autodetect:</p> <ul> <li>multiple attributes can be specified - all must be match for the record to be recognized as belonging to this schema.</li> <li>if the attributes have a namespace then the namespace should be specified on the autodetect element or somewhere in the schema-ident.xml document.</li> </ul> <p>2. Elements - Find one or more elements in the document. An example use case is the one shown in the example schema-ident.xml file earlier:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect xmlns:mcp=\"http://bluenet3.antcrc.utas.edu.au/mcp\" \n            xmlns:gmd=\"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd\" \n            xmlns:gco=\"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gco\"&gt;\n  &lt;elements&gt;\n    &lt;gmd:metadataStandardName&gt;\n      &lt;gco:CharacterString&gt;\n        Australian Marine Community Profile of ISO 19115:2005/19139|\n        Marine Community Profile of ISO 19115:2005/19139\n      &lt;/gco:CharacterString&gt;\n    &lt;/gmd:metadataStandardName&gt;\n    &lt;gmd:metadataStandardVersion&gt;\n      &lt;gco:CharacterString&gt;\n        1.5-experimental|\n        MCP:BlueNet V1.5-experimental|\n        MCP:BlueNet V1.5\n      &lt;/gco:CharacterString&gt;\n    &lt;/gmd:metadataStandardVersion&gt;\n  &lt;/elements&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Some other points about elements autodetect:</p> <ul> <li>multiple elements can be specified - eg. as in the above, both metadataStandardName and metadataStandardVersion have been specified - all must be match for the record to be recognized as belonging to this schema.</li> <li>multiple values for the elements can be specified. eg. as in the above, a match for gmd:metadataStandardVersion will be found for <code>1.5-experimental</code> OR <code>MCP:BlueNet V1.5-experimental</code> OR <code>MCP:BlueNet V1.5</code> - the vertical line or pipe character '|' is used to separate the options here.</li> <li>if the elements have a namespace then the namespace(s) should be specified on the autodetect element or somewhere in the schema-ident.xml document before the element in which they are used - eg. in the above there are there namespace declarations on the autodetect element so as not to clutter the content.</li> </ul> <p>3. Root element - root element of the document must match. An example use case is the one used for the eml-gbif schema. Documents belonging to this schema always have root element of eml:eml so the autodetect section for this schema is:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect xmlns:eml=\"eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1\"&gt;\n    &lt;elements type=\"root\"&gt;\n        &lt;eml:eml/&gt;\n    &lt;/elements&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Some other points about root element autodetect:</p> <ul> <li>multiple elements can be specified - any element in the set that matches the root element of the record will trigger a match.</li> <li>if the elements have a namespace then the namespace(s) should be specified on the autodetect element or somewhere in the schema-ident.xml document before the element that uses them - eg. as in the above there is a namespace declaration on the autodetect element for clarity.</li> </ul> <p>4. Namespaces - Find one or more namespaces in the document. An example use case is the one used for the csw:Record schema. Records belonging to the csw:Record schema can have three possible root elements: csw:Record, csw:SummaryRecord and csw:BriefRecord, but instead of using a multiple element root autodetect, we could use the common csw namespace for autodetect as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect&gt;\n  &lt;namespaces xmlns:csw=\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/2.0.2\"/&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Some other points about namespaces autodetect:</p> <ul> <li>multiple namespaces can be specified - all must be present for the record to be recognized as belonging to this schema.</li> <li>the prefix is ignored. A namespace match occurs if the namespace URI found in the record matches the namespace URI specified in the namespaces autodetect element.</li> </ul> <p>5. Default schema - This is the fail-safe provision for records that don't match any of the installed schemas. The value for the default schema is specified in the appHandler configuration of the <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml</code> config file or it could be a default specified by the operation calling autodetect (eg. a value parsed from a user bulk loading some metadata records). For flexibility and accuracy reasons it is preferable that records be detected using the autodetect information of an installed schema. The default schema is just a 'catch all' method of assigning records to a specific schema. The config element in <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml</code> looks like the following:</p> <pre><code>&lt;appHandler class=\"org.fao.geonet.Geonetwork\"&gt;\n    .....\n    &lt;param name=\"preferredSchema\" value=\"iso19139\" /&gt;\n    .....\n&lt;/appHandler&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"developer/schemaPlugins/#more-on-autodetect-evaluation","title":"More on autodetect evaluation","text":"<p>The rules for autodetect are evaluated as follows:</p> <pre><code>for-each autodetect rule type in ( 'attributes/namespaces', 'elements', \n                                   'namespaces', 'root element' )\n    for-each schema \n        if schema has autodetect rule type then \n            check rule for a match\n            if match add to list of previous matches\n        end if\n    end for-each\n\n    if more than one match throw 'SCHEMA RULE CONFLICT EXCEPTION'\n    if one match then set matched = first match and break loop\nend for-each\n\nif no match then \n  if namespaces of record and default schema overlap then \n        set match = default schema\n    else throw 'NO SCHEMA MATCHES EXCEPTION'\nend if\n\nreturn matched schema\n</code></pre> <p>As an example, suppose we have three schemas iso19139.mcp, iso19139.mcp-1.4 and iso19139.mcp-cmar with the following autodetect elements:</p> <p>iso19139.mcp-1.4:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect xmlns:mcp=\"http://bluenet3.antcrc.utas.edu.au/mcp\" \n            xmlns:gmd=\"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd\" \n            xmlns:gco=\"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gco\"&gt;\n  &lt;elements&gt;\n    &lt;gmd:metadataStandardName&gt;\n      &lt;gco:CharacterString&gt;\n        Australian Marine Community Profile of ISO 19115:2005/19139\n      &lt;/gco:CharacterString&gt;\n    &lt;/gmd:metadataStandardName&gt;\n    &lt;gmd:metadataStandardVersion&gt;\n      &lt;gco:CharacterString&gt;MCP:BlueNet V1.4&lt;/gco:CharacterString&gt;\n    &lt;/gmd:metadataStandardVersion&gt;\n  &lt;/elements&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>iso19139.mcp-cmar:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect&gt;\n    &lt;attributes xmlns:mcp-cmar=\"http://www.marine.csiro.au/schemas/mcp-cmar\"&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>iso19139.mcp:</p> <pre><code>&lt;autodetect xmlns:mcp=\"http://bluenet3.antcrc.utas.edu.au/mcp\"&gt;\n    &lt;elements type=\"root\"&gt;\n        &lt;mcp:MD_Metadata/&gt;\n    &lt;/elements&gt;\n&lt;/autodetect&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>A record going through autodetect processing (eg. on import) would be checked against:</p> <ul> <li>iso19139.mcp-cmar first as it has an 'attributes' rule</li> <li>then iso19139.mcp-1.4 as it has an 'elements' rules</li> <li>then finally against iso19139.mcp, as it has a 'root element' rule.</li> </ul> <p>The idea behind this processing algorithm is that base schemas will use a 'root element' rule (or the more difficult to control 'namespaces' rule) and profiles will use a finer or more specific rule such as 'attributes' or 'elements'.</p> <p>After setting up schema-ident.xml, our new GeoNetwork plugin schema for MCP contains:</p> <pre><code>schema-ident.xml\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"developer/schemaPlugins/#schema_conversions","title":"Creating the schema-conversions.xml file","text":"<p>This file describes the converters that can be applied to metadata records that belong to the schema.

The idea behind this approach is twofold. Firstly, the editor can use the XML schema definition rules to help the user avoid creating a document that is structurally incorrect eg. missing mandatory elements or elements not ordered correctly. Secondly, the same editor code can be used on any XML metadata document with a defined XSD.</p> <p>If you are defining your own metadata schema then you can create an XML schema document using the XSD language. The elements of the language can be found online at http://www.w3schools.com/schema/ or you can refer to a textbook such as Priscilla Walmsley's Definitive XML Schema (Prentice Hall, 2002). GeoNetwork's XML schema parsing code understands almost all of the XSD language with the exception of redefine, any and anyAttribute (although the last two can be handled under special circumstances).</p> <p>In the case of the Marine Commuity Profile, we are basically defining a number of extensions to the base standard ISO19115/19139. These extensions are defined using the XSD extension mechanism on the types defined in ISO19139. The following snippet shows how the Marine Community Profile extends the gmd:MD_Metadata element to add a new element called revisionDate:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xs:schema targetNamespace=\"http://bluenet3.antcrc.utas.edu.au/mcp\" \n           xmlns:mcp=\"http://bluenet3.antcrc.utas.edu.au/mcp\" .....&gt;\n\n....\n\n&lt;xs:element name=\"MD_Metadata\" substitutionGroup=\"gmd:MD_Metadata\" \n                               type=\"mcp:MD_Metadata_Type\"/&gt;\n\n&lt;xs:complexType name=\"MD_Metadata_Type\"&gt;\n  &lt;xs:annotation&gt;\n    &lt;xs:documentation&gt;\n     Extends the metadata element to include revisionDate\n    &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;\n  &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;\n  &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;\n    &lt;xs:extension base=\"gmd:MD_Metadata_Type\"&gt;\n      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n        &lt;xs:element name=\"revisionDate\" type=\"gco:Date_PropertyType\" \n                    minOccurs=\"0\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n      &lt;xs:attribute ref=\"gco:isoType\" use=\"required\" \n                    fixed=\"gmd:MD_Metadata\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:extension&gt;\n  &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;\n&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In short, we have defined a new element mcp:MD_Metadata with type mcp:MD_Metadata_Type, which is an extension of gmd:MD_Metadata_Type. By extension, we mean that the new type includes all of the elements of the old type plus one new element, mcp:revisionDate. A mandatory attribute (gco:isoType) is also attached to mcp:MD_Metadata with a fixed value set to the name of the element that we extended (gmd:MD_Metadata).</p> <p>By defining the profile in this way, it is not necessary to modify the underlying ISO19139 schemas. So the schema directory for the MCP essentially consists of the extensions plus the base ISO19139 schemas. One possible directory structure is as follows:</p> <pre><code>extensions  gco  gmd  gml  gmx  gsr  gss  gts  resources  srv  xlink\n</code></pre> <p>The extensions directory contains a single file mcpExtensions.xsd, which imports the gmd namespace. The remaining directories are the ISO19139 base schemas.</p> <p>The schema.xsd file, which is the file GeoNetwork looks for, will import the mcpExtensions.xsd file and any other namespaces not imported as part of the base ISO19139 schema.

XSLTs","text":"<p>GeoNetwork needs to extract certain information from a metadata record and translate it into a common, simplified XML structure that is independent of the metadata schema.

For the MCP, this information is held in the mcp:revisionDate element which is a child of mcp:MD_Metadata. The easiest way to create this for MCP is to copy extract-date-modified.xsl from the iso19139 schema and modify it to suit the MCP namespace and to use mcp:revisionDate in place of gmd:dateStamp.</li> <li>extract-gml.xsl - this XSLT processes the metadata record and extracts the spatial extent as a gml GeometryCollection element. The gml is passed to geotools for insertion into the spatial index (either a shapefile or a spatial database). For ISO19115/19139 and profiles, this task is quite easy because spatial extents (apart from the bounding box) are encoded as gml in the metadata record. Again, the easiest way to create this for the MCP is to copy extract-gml.xsd from the iso19139 schema ad modify it to suit the MCP namespace.</li> </ul> <p>An example bounding box fragment from an MCP metadata record is:</p> <pre><code>&lt;gmd:extent&gt;\n  &lt;gmd:EX_Extent&gt;\n    &lt;gmd:geographicElement&gt;\n      &lt;gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox&gt;\n        &lt;gmd:westBoundLongitude&gt;\n          &lt;gco:Decimal&gt;112.9&lt;/gco:Decimal&gt;\n        &lt;/gmd:westBoundLongitude&gt;\n        &lt;gmd:eastBoundLongitude&gt;\n          &lt;gco:Decimal&gt;153.64&lt;/gco:Decimal&gt;\n        &lt;/gmd:eastBoundLongitude&gt;\n        &lt;gmd:southBoundLatitude&gt;\n          &lt;gco:Decimal&gt;-43.8&lt;/gco:Decimal&gt;\n        &lt;/gmd:southBoundLatitude&gt;\n        &lt;gmd:northBoundLatitude&gt;\n          &lt;gco:Decimal&gt;-9.0&lt;/gco:Decimal&gt;\n        &lt;/gmd:northBoundLatitude&gt;\n      &lt;/gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox&gt;\n    &lt;/gmd:geographicElement&gt;\n  &lt;/gmd:EX_Extent&gt;\n&lt;/gmd:extent&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Running extract-gml.xsl on the metadata record that contains this XML will produce:</p> <pre><code>&lt;gml:GeometryCollection xmlns:gml=\"http://www.opengis.net/gml\"&gt;\n  &lt;gml:Polygon&gt;\n    &lt;gml:exterior&gt;\n      &lt;gml:LinearRing&gt;\n        &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;\n          112.9,-9.0, 153.64,-9.0, 153.64,-43.8, 112.9,-43.8, 112.9,-9.0\n        &lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;\n      &lt;/gml:LinearRing&gt;\n    &lt;/gml:exterior&gt;\n  &lt;/gml:Polygon&gt;\n&lt;/gml:GeometryCollection&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>If there is more than one extent in the metadata record, then they should also appear in this gml:GeometryCollection element.</p> <p>To find out more about gml, see Lake, Burggraf, Trninic and Rae, \"GML Geography Mark-Up Language, Foundation for the Geo-Web\", Wiley, 2004.</p> <p>Finally, a note on projections. It is possible to have bounding polygons in an MCP record in a projection other than EPSG:4326. GeoNetwork transforms all projections known to GeoTools (and encoded in a form that GeoTools understands) to EPSG:4326 when writing the spatial extents to the shapefile or spatial database.</p> <ul> <li>extract-uuid.xsl - this XSLT processes the metadata record and extracts the identifier for the record.

These XSLTs are held in the <code>present</code> directory.</p> <p>To be be used in the XSLT include/import hierarchy these XSLTs must follow a naming convention: metadata-.xsl. So for example, the presentation xslt for the iso19139 schema is <code>metadata-iso19139.xsl</code>. For the MCP, since our schema name is iso19139.mcp, the presentation XSLT would be called <code>metadata-iso19193.mcp.xsl</code>. <p>Any XSLTs included by the presentation XSLT should also be in the present directory (this is a convention for clarity - it is not mandatory as include/import URLs can be mapped in the oasis-catalog.xml for the schema to other locations).</p> <p>There are certain XSLT templates that the presentation XSLT must have:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the main template, which must be called: metadata-. For the MCP profile of iso19139 the main template would look like the following (taken from metadata-iso19139.mcp.xsl): <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template name=\"metadata-iso19139.mcp\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\" select=\"false()\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"embedded\"/&gt;\n\n  &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=\"iso19139\" select=\".\" &gt;\n    &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\" select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"embedded\" select=\"$embedded\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Analyzing this template:</p> <ol> <li>The name=\"metadata-iso19139.mcp\" is used by the main element processing template in metadata.xsl: elementEP. The main metadata services, show and edit, end up calling metadata-show.xsl and metadata-edit.xsl respectively with the metadata record passed from the Java service. Both these XSLTs, process the metadata record by applying the elementEP template from metadata.xsl to the root element. The elementEP template calls this main schema template using the schema name iso19139.mcp.</li> <li> <p>The job of this main template is set to process all the elements of the metadata record using templates declared with a mode name that matches the schema name or the name of the base schema (in this case iso19139). This modal processing is to ensure that only templates intended to process metadata elements from this schema or the base schema are applied. The reason for this is that almost all profiles change or add a small number of elements to those in the base schema. So most of the metadata elements in a profile can be processed in the mode of the base schema. We'll see later in this section how to override processing of an element in the base schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>a completeTab template, which must be called: CompleteTab. This template will display all tabs, apart from the 'default' (or simple mode) and the 'XML View' tabs, in the left hand frame of the editor/viewer screen. Here is an example for the MCP: <p>``` xml  <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>...... (same as for iso19139CompleteTab in   GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/schema_plugins/iso19139/present/  metadata-iso19139.xsl) ......</p> <p> ````</p> <p>This template is called by the template named \"tab\" (which also adds the \"default\" and \"XML View\" tabs) in <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/xsl/metadata-tab-utils.xsl</code> using the schema name. That XSLT also has the code for the \"displayTab\" template.</p> <p>'mcpMinimum', 'mcpCore', 'complete' etc are the names of the tabs. The name of the current or active tab is stored in the global variable \"currTab\" available to all presentation XSLTs. Logic to decide what to display when a particular tab is active should be contained in the root element processing tab.</p> <ul> <li> <p>a root element processing tab. This tab should match on the root element of the metadata record. For example, for the iso19139 schema:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139\" match=\"gmd:MD_Metadata\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"embedded\"/&gt;\n\n  &lt;xsl:choose&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- metadata tab --&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:when test=\"$currTab='metadata'\"&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:call-template name=\"iso19139Metadata\"&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\" select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:when&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- identification tab --&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:when test=\"$currTab='identification'\"&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=\"elementEP\" select=\"gmd:identificationInfo|geonet:child[string(@name)='identificationInfo']\"&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\" select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:when&gt;\n\n  .........\n\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>This template is basically a very long \"choose\" statement with \"when\" clauses that test the value of the currently defined tab (in global variable currTab). Each \"when\" clause will display the set of metadata elements that correspond to the tab definition using \"elementEP\" directly (as in the \"when\" clause for the 'identification' tab above) or via a named template (as in the 'metadata' tab above). For the MCP our template is similar to the one above for iso19139, except that the match would be on \"mcp:MD_Metadata\" (and the processing mode may differ - see the section 'An alternative XSLT design for profiles' below for more details).</p> <ul> <li> <p>a brief template, which must be called: Brief. This template processes the metadata record and extracts from it a format neutral summary of the metadata for purposes such as displaying the search results. Here is an example for the eml-gbif schema (because it is fairly short!): <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=\"eml-gbifBrief\"&gt;\n &lt;xsl:for-each select=\"/metadata/*[1]\"&gt;\n  &lt;metadata&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"normalize-space(dataset/title[1])\"/&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;abstract&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"dataset/abstract\"/&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=\"dataset/keywordSet/keyword\"&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:copy-of select=\".\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n    &lt;geoBox&gt;\n        &lt;westBL&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage/boundingCoordinates/westBoundingCoordinate\"/&gt;&lt;/westBL&gt;\n        &lt;eastBL&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage/boundingCoordinates/eastBoundingCoordinate\"/&gt;&lt;/eastBL&gt;\n        &lt;southBL&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage/boundingCoordinates/southBoundingCoordinate\"/&gt;&lt;/southBL&gt;\n        &lt;northBL&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage/boundingCoordinates/northBoundingCoordinate\"/&gt;&lt;/northBL&gt;\n    &lt;/geoBox&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=\"geonet:info\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/metadata&gt;\n &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Analyzing this template:</p> <ol> <li>The template matches on an element eml-gbifBrief, created by the mode=\"brief\" template in metadata-utils.xsl. The metadata record will be the first child in the /metadata XPath.</li> <li>Then process metadata elements to produce a flat XML structure that is used by search-results-xhtml.xsl to display a summary of the metadata record found by a search.</li> </ol> <p>Once again, for profiles of an existing schema, it makes sense to use a slighlty different approach so that the profile need not duplicate templates. Here is an example from metadata-iso19139.mcp.xsl:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=\"iso19139.mcpBrief\"&gt;\n  &lt;metadata&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=\"/metadata/*[1]\"&gt;\n      &lt;!-- call iso19139 brief --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=\"iso19139-brief\"/&gt;\n      &lt;!-- now brief elements for mcp specific elements --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=\"iso19139.mcp-brief\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n  &lt;/metadata&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This template splits the processing between the base iso19139 schema and a brief template that handles elements specific to the profile. This assumes that:</p> <ol> <li>The base schema has separated the  element from the remainder of its brief processing so that it can be called by profiles <li> <p>The profile includes links to equivalent elements that can be used by the base schema to process common elements eg. for ISO19139, elements in the profile have gco:isoType attributes that give the name of the base element and can be used in XPath matches such as \"gmd:MD_DataIdentification|*[@gco:isoType='gmd:MD_DataIdentification']\".</p> </li> <li> <p>templates that match on elements specific to the schema. Here is an example from the eml-gbif schema:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!-- keywords are processed to add thesaurus name in brackets afterwards \n     in view mode --&gt;\n\n&lt;xsl:template mode=\"eml-gbif\" match=\"keywordSet\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\"/&gt;\n\n  &lt;xsl:choose&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:when test=\"$edit=false()\"&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:variable name=\"keyword\"&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:for-each select=\"keyword\"&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:if test=\"position() &amp;gt; 1\"&gt;,  &lt;/xsl:if&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:value-of select=\".\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:if test=\"keywordThesaurus\"&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:text&gt; (&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"keywordThesaurus\"/&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:text&gt;)&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:if&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=\"simpleElement\" select=\".\"&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\" select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"text\"    select=\"$keyword\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:when&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=\"complexElement\" select=\".\"&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\" select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> <p>Analyzing this template:</p> <ol> <li>In view mode the individual keywords from the set are concatenated into a comma separated string with the name of the thesaurus in brackets at the end.</li> <li>In edit mode, the keywordSet is handled as a complex element ie. the user can add individual keyword elements with content and a single thesaurus name.</li> <li>This is an example of the type of processing that can be done on an element in a metadata record.</li> </ol> <p>For profiles, templates for elements can be defined in the same way except that the template will process in the mode of the base schema. Here is an example showing the first few lines of a template for processing the mcp:revisionDate element:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139\" match=\"mcp:revisionDate\"&gt;\n   &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n   &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\"/&gt;\n\n   &lt;xsl:choose&gt;\n     &lt;xsl:when test=\"$edit=true()\"&gt;\n       &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=\"simpleElement\" select=\".\"&gt;\n         &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"schema\"  select=\"$schema\"/&gt;\n         &lt;xsl:with-param name=\"edit\"   select=\"$edit\"/&gt;\n\n   ......\n</code></pre> <p>If a template for a profile is intended to override a template in the base schema, then the template can be defined in the presentation XSLT for the profile with a priority attribute set to a high number and an XPath condition that ensures the template is processed for the profile only. For example in the MCP, we can override the handling of gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox in metadata-iso19139.xsl by defining a template in metadata-iso19139.mcp.xsl as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139\" match=\"gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox[starts-with(//geonet:info/schema,'iso19139.mcp')]\" priority=\"3\"&gt;\n\n......\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, a profile may also extend some of the existing codelists in the base schema. These extended codelists should be held in a localized codelists.xml. As an example, in iso19139 these codelists are often attached to elements like the following:</p> <pre><code>&lt;gmd:role&gt;\n  &lt;gmd:CI_RoleCode codeList=\"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/resources/Codelist/gmxCodelists.xml#CI_RoleCode\" codeListValue=\"custodian\"&gt;custodian&lt;/gmd:CI_RoleCode&gt;\n&lt;/gmd:role&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Templates for handling these elements are in the iso19139 presentation XSLT <code>GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/schema_plugins/iso19139/present/metadata-iso19139.xsl</code>. These templates use the name of the element (eg. gmd:CI_RoleCode) and the codelist XPath (eg. /root/gui/schemas/iso19139/codelists) to build select list/drop down menus when editing and to display a full description when viewing. See templates near the template named 'iso19139Codelist'. These templates can handle the extended codelists for any profile because they:</p> <ul> <li>match on any element that has a child element with attribute codeList</li> <li>use the schema name in the codelists XPath</li> <li>fall back to the base iso19139 schema if the profile codelist doesn't have the required codelist</li> </ul> <p>However, if you don't need localized codelists, it is often easier and more direct to extract codelists directly from the <code>gmxCodelists.xml</code> file. This is in fact the solution that has been adopted for the MCP.

The main metadata services, show and edit, end up calling metadata-show.xsl and metadata-edit.xsl respectively with the metadata record passed from the Java service. Both these XSLTs, process the metadata record by applying the elementEP template from metadata.xsl to the root element. elementEP calls the appropriate main schema template using the schema name.</li> <li> <p>The job of this main template is set to process all the elements of the metadata profile. The processing takes place in one of two modes. Firstly, the element is processed in the profile mode (iso19139.mcp). If a match is found then HTML elements will be returned and copied to the output document. If no HTML elements are returned then the element is processed in the base schema mode, iso19139.</p> </li> <li> <p>templates that match on elements specific to the profile have mode iso19139.mcp:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139.mcp\" match=\"mcp:taxonomicElement\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\"/&gt;\n\n  .....\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt; \n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>templates that override elements in the base schema are processed in the profile mode iso19139.mcp</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139.mcp\" match=\"gmd:keyword\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"schema\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:param name=\"edit\"/&gt;\n\n  .....\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt; \n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>Notice that the template header of the profile has a simpler design than that used for the original design? Neither the priority attribute or the schema XPath condition is required because we are using a different mode to the base schema.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To support processing in two modes we need to add a null template to the profile mode iso19139.mcp as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template mode=\"iso19139.mcp\" match=\"*|@*\"/&gt; \n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>This template will match all elements that we don't have a specific template for in the profile mode iso19139.mcp.

A simple example of the content of this file is shown below:</p> <pre><code>&lt;schemas&gt;\n  &lt;schema prefix=\"oai_dc\" nsUrl=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/\" \n          schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\"/&gt;\n&lt;/schemas&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In the case of the prefix oai_dc shown above, if a schema converter with prefix oai_dc exists in the <code>schema-conversions.xml</code> file of a GeoNetwork schema, then records that belong to this schema will be transformed and included in OAIPMH requests for the oai_dc prefix. See Creating the schema-conversions.xml file for more info.</p> <p>To add oai_dc support for the MCP, the easiest method is to copy oai_dc.xsl from the convert directory of the iso19139 schema, modify it to cope with the different namespaces and additional elements of the MCP and add it to the <code>schema-conversions.xml</code> file for the MCP.</p>"},{"location":"developer/settings/","title":"Settings hierarchy","text":""},{"location":"developer/settings/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>GeoNetwork stores configuration settings in the Settings table.

These services are much like HTML addresses but return XML instead of HTML. The advantage of using XML, is that XML services can be used in machine-to-machine interfaces. As an example, consider the <code>xml.info</code> service - <code>xml.info</code>: you might have an application which can use this service to get information about GeoNetwork users and metadata schemas in XML. The user information returned by this service could then be used by your application to decide how to authenticate with GeoNetwork so that metadata records from a particular metadata schema could be retrieved from other GeoNetwork XML services and processed by your application.</p> <p>As a general rule, XML services provided by GeoNetwork usually have a <code>xml.</code> prefix in their address. To keep things simple and uniform, GeoNetwork XML services accept XML documents (or convert parameters to XML documents) and return information, status and errors as XML documents (except for a few services that relate to file download and must return binary data).</p>"},{"location":"developer/xml_services/services_calling/#request","title":"Request","text":"<p>Each service accepts a set of parameters, which must be embedded in the request. A service can be called using different HTTP methods, depending on the structure of its request:</p> <ul> <li>GET The parameters are sent as part of the URL address.

A service can be called this way only if the parameters it accepts are not structured.

The first case is very common when sending web forms while the second one is used to send binary data (usually files) to the server. In these cases, the parameters are not structured so the rules of the GET method applies. Even if the second case could be used to send XML documents, this possibility is not considered on the server side.</li> <li>XML The content type is application/xml. This is the common case when the client is not a browser but a specialised client. The request is a pure XML document in string form, encoded using the encoding specified into the prologue of the XML document. Using this form, any type of request can be made (structured or not) so any service can be called.</li> <li>SOAP The content type is application/soap+xml. SOAP is a simple protocol used to access objects and services using XML. Clients that use this protocol can embed XML requests into a SOAP structure. On the server side, GeoNetwork will remove the SOAP structure and feed the content to the service. Its response will be embedded again into a SOAP structure and sent back to the caller.

Lucene is very fast and scale for large catalogs if you supply fast disk (solid state disk is best by far), lots of memory/RAM (16Gb+) and multiple processors as part of a 64bit environment. Linux is probably the best operating system to take advantage of such an environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build the spatial index into your database ie. Use PostGIS (Postgres+PostGIS) or Oracle as your database GeoNetwork has to build a spatial index containing all metadata bounding boxes and polygons, in order to support spatial queries for the Catalog Services Web (CSW) interface eg. select all metadata records that intersect a search polygon. By default GeoNetwork uses a shapefile but the shapefile quickly becomes costly to maintain during reindexing usually after the number of records in the catalog exceeds 20,000. If you select PostGIS or Oracle as your database via JNDI (see previous section), GeoNetwork will build the spatial index in a table (called spatialindex). The spatialindex table in the database is much faster to reindex. But more importantly, if appropriate database hardware and configuration steps are taken, it should also be faster to query than the shapefile when the number of records in the catalog becomes very large.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the Java heap space Typically as much memory as you can give GeoNetwork is the answer here. If you have a 32bit machine then you are stuck below 2Gb (or maybe a little higher with some hacks). A 64bit machine is best for large catalogs. Jetty users can set the Java heap space in <code>INSTALL_DIR/bin/start-geonetwork.sh</code> (see the -Xmx option: eg. -Xmx4g will set the heap space to 4Gb on a 64bit machine). Tomcat users can set an environment variable JAVA_OPTS eg. export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xmx4g\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the number of processors you wish to allocate to GeoNetwork GeoNetwork 2.8 allows you to use more than one system processor (or core) to speed up reindexing and batch operations on large numbers of metadata records. The records to be processed are split into groups with each group assigned to an execution thread. You can specify how many threads can be used in the system configuration menu. A reasonable value for the number of threads is the number of processors or cores you have allocated to the GeoNetwork Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or just the number of processors on the machine that you have dedicated to GeoNetwork.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the number of database connections to be allocated to GeoNetwork GeoNetwork uses and reuses a pool of database connections. This is configured in <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml</code> or in the container via JNDI. To arrive at a reasonable number for the pool size is not straight forward. You need to consider the number of concurrent harvesters you will run, the number of concurrent batch import and batch operations you expect to run and the number of concurrent users you are expecting to arrive. The default value of 10 is really only for small sites. The more connections you can allocate, the less time your users and other tasks will spend waiting for a free connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the maximum number of files your system will allow any process to have open Most operating systems will only allow a process to open a limited number of files. If you are expecting a large number of records to be in your catalog then you should change the default value to something larger (eg. 4096) as the lucene index in GeoNetwork will occasionally require large numbers of open files during reindexing. In Linux this value can be changed using the ulimit command (ulimit -a typically shows you the current setting). Find a value that suits your needs and add the appropriate ulimit command (eg. ulimit -n 4096) to the GeoNetwork startup script to make sure that the new limit is used when GeoNetwork is started.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raise the stack size limit for the postgres database Each process has some memory allocated as a stack. The stack is used to store process arguments and variables as well as state when functions are called. Most operating systems limit the size that the stack can grow to. With large catalogs and spatial searches, very large SQL queries can be generated on the PostGIS spatial index table. This can cause postgres to exceed the process stack size limit (typically 8192k on smaller machines). You will know when this happens because a very long SQL query will be output to the GeoNetwork log file prefixed with a cryptic message something along the lines of:</p> <pre><code>java.util.NoSuchElementException: Could not acquire \nfeature:org.geotools.data.DataSourceException: Error Performing SQL query: SELECT .........\n</code></pre> <p>In Linux the stack size can be changed using the ulimit command (ulimit -a typically shows you the current setting). You will need to choose a value and set it (eg. ulimit -s 262140) in the shell startup script of the postgres user (eg. .bashrc if using the bash shell). The setting may also need to be added to the postgres config - see \"max_stack_depth\" in the postgresql.conf file for your system. You may also have to enable to postgres user to change the stack size in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>. After this has been done, restart postgres.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you need to support a catalog with more than 1 million records GeoNetwork creates a directory for each record that in turn contains a <code>ic</code> and a <code>te</code> directory for holding attached data and thumbnails. These directories are in the GeoNetwork <code>ta</code> directory - typically: <code>INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/data</code> - see <code>GeoNetwork data directory](index.rst#geonetwork_data_dir). This can exhaust the number of inodes available in a Linux file system (you will often see misleading error reports saying that the filesystem is 'out of space' - even though the filesystem may have lots of freespace). Check this using [df -i</code>. Since inodes are allocated statically when the filesystem is created for most common filesystems (including extfs4), it is rather inconvenient to have to backup all your data and recreate the filesystem! So if you are planning a large catalog with over 1 million records, make sure that you create a filesystem on your machine with the number of inodes set to at least 5x (and to be safe 10x) the number of records you are expecting to hold and let GeoNetwork create its <code>ta</code> directory on that filesystem.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"users/admin/advanced-configuration/#geonetwork_data_dir","title":"GeoNetwork data directory","text":"<p>When customizing Geonetwork for a specific deployment server you need to be able to modify the configuration for that specific server.

In both configurations 90% of the configuration is the same but certain parts need to be updated.</p> <p>An override file to be specified as a system property or as a servlet init parameter: jeeves.configuration.overrides.file.</p> The order of resolution is: <ul> <li>System property with key: {servlet.getServletContext().getServletContextName()}.jeeves.configuration.overrides.file</li> <li>Servlet init parameter with key: jeeves.configuration.overrides.file</li> <li>System property with key: jeeves.configuration.overrides.file</li> <li>Servlet context init parameters with key: jeeves.configuration.overrides.file</li> </ul> The property should be a path or a URL. The method used to find a overrides file is as follows: <ol> <li>It is attempted to be used as a URL. if an exception occurs the next option is tried</li> <li>It is assumed to be a path and uses the servlet context to look up the resources. If it can not be found the next option is tried</li> <li>It is assumed to be a file. If the file is not found then an exception is thrown</li> </ol> <p>An example of a overrides file is as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;overrides&gt;\n    &lt;!-- import values.

This can be done using an XPath. eg. the XPath <code>/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:contact/gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty/gmd:contactInfo/gmd:CI_Contact</code> identifies metadata contact information in iso19139 metadata records. An example of such a fragment (taken from one of the GeoNetwork sample records) is shown in the following example:</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;\n</code></pre> Viale delle Terme di Caracalla Rome 00153 Italy jippe.hoogeveen@fao.org </p> <ul> <li>Identify and record the XPath of a field or fields within the fragment which text content will be used as the title of the subtemplate. It is important to choose a set of fields that will allow a human to identify the subtemplate when they choose to either reuse the subtemplate in a new record or edit in the subtemplate directories interface. This XPath should be relative to the root element of the fragment identified in the previous step. So for example, in the fragment above we could choose <code>gmd:address/gmd:CI_Address/gmd:electronicMailAddress/gco:CharacterString</code> as the title for the fragments to be created.</li> <li>On the GeoNetwork home page, search for and then select the records from which the subtemplates will be extracted. Choose \"Extract subtemplates\" from the \"actions on selection\" menu as shown in the following screenshot:</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Fill in the form with the information collected in the previous steps. It should look something like the following:</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Run the extract subtemplate function in test mode (ie. without checking the \"I really want to do this\" box). This will test whether your XPaths are correct by extracting one subtemplate from the selected set of records and displaying the results.</li> <li>If you are happy with the test results, go ahead with the actual extraction by checking the \"I really want to do this\" checkbox. After the extraction completes you should see some results.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Finally, go to the subtemplate directory management interface and you should be able to select the root element of your subtemplates to examine the extracted subtemplates.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>The metadata records from which the subtemplates were extracted now have xlinks to the subtemplates.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"users/managing_metadata/fragments/#managing-the-fragment-cache","title":"Managing the fragment cache","text":"<p>If metadata records in your catalog link in fragments from external sites, GeoNetwork caches these fragments after the first look up so as to reduce the amount of network traffic and speed up the display of metadata records in search results.</p> <p>The cache is handled automatically using the Java Cache System (JCS).

It is a combination of the network interface MAC address, the current date/time and a random number. Every time you create a new metadata record in GeoNetwork, a new UUID is generated and assigned to it.</p> <p>Another important concept behind the harvesting is the last change date. Every time you change a metadata record, the last change date is updated. Just storing this parameter and comparing it with a new one allows any system to find out if the metadata record has been modified since last update.</p> <p>These two concepts allow GeoNetwork to fetch remote metadata, check if it has been updated and remove it locally if it has been removed remotely.

To do this you should check Create metadata for Collection Datasets and ignore the atomic datasets.</p> <p>Next, because the metadata in this catalog follows Unidata data discovery conventions, so we will choose Extract Unidata dataset discovery metadata using fragments.</p> <p>Next, we will check Ignore harvesting attribute. We do this because datasets in the THREDDS catalog can have an attribute indicating whether the dataset should be harvested or not. Since none of the datasets in this catalog have the harvesting attribute, we will ignore it. If we didn't check this box, all the datasets would be skipped.</p> <p>Next we will select the metadata schema that the harvested metadata will be written out in. We will choose iso19139 here because this is the schema for which we have stylesheets that will convert THREDDS metadata to fragments of iso19139 metadata and a template into which these fragments of metadata can be copied or linked. After choosing iso19139, choices will appear that show these stylesheets and templates.</p> <p>The first choice is the stylesheet that will create iso19139 metadata fragments. Because we are interested in the thredds metadata elements in the THREDDS catalog, we will choose the (iso19139) thredds-metadata (located in <code>GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/config/schema_plugins/iso19139/convert/ThreddsToFragments</code>) to convert these elements to iso19139 metadata fragments.</p> <p>For the purposes of this demonstration, we will not check Create subtemplates for fragments (xlinks...). This means that the fragments of metadata created by the stylesheet will be copied directly into the metadata template. They will not be able to be reused (eg. shared between different metadata records). See the earlier section on metadata fragments if you are not sure what this means.</p> <p>Finally, we will choose HARVESTING TEMPLATE - THREDDS - UNIDATA DISCOVERY as the template metadata record that will be combined with the metadata fragments to create the output records. This template will have been loaded into GeoNetwork from <code>GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/config/schema_plugins/iso19139/templates/thredds-harvester-unidata-data-discovery.xml</code> through the Add Templates function in the Administration interface. This template could be filled out with metadata common to all records before the harvester is run. The process by which the template is used to create metadata records is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>For each dataset in the THREDDS catalog, the template will be copied to create a new iso19139 metadata record</li> <li>Each fragment of metadata harvested from a THREDDS dataset will be copied into the new iso19139 metadata record by matching an identifier in the template with an identifier in the fragment (this match is created by the developer of the template and the stylesheet).</li> <li>The new record is then inserted into the GeoNetwork metadata catalog and the record content is indexed in Lucene for searching.</li> </ol> <p>You can then fill out the remainder of the form according to how often you want the harvested metadata to be updated, what categories will be assigned to the created metadata record, which icon will be displayed with the metadata records in the search results and what the privileges on the created metadata records will be.</p> <p>Save the harvester screen. Then from the harvesting management screen, check the box beside the newly created harvester, Activate it and then Run it. After a few moments (depending on your internet connection and machine) you should click on Refresh. If your harvest has been successful you should see a results panel appear something like the one shown in the following screenshot.</p> <p> Results of harvesting collection records from a motherlode THREDDS catalog</p> <p>Notice that there were 48 metadata records created for the 48 collection level datasets in this THREDDS catalog.

The following screenshot shows the parameters for batch import of a set of XML or MEF files.</p> <p> The batch import options</p> <ul> <li>Directory This is the full path on the server's file system of the directory to scan. GeoNetwork will look for and try to import all XML or MEF files present into this directory. It is important to notice that this is the directory on the server machine and not on the client of the user that is doing the import.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>File Type - First option is to choose the type of metadata record you are loading. The two choices are:</p> <ul> <li>Metadata - use when loading a normal metadata record</li> <li>Template - use when loading a metadata record that will be used as a template to build new records in the editor.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Import Action - This option group determines how to handle potential clashes between the UUID of the metadata record you are loading and the UUIDs of metadata records already present in the catalog. There are three actions and you can select one:</p> <ul> <li>No action on import - the UUID of the metadata record you are loading is left unchanged. If a metadata record with the same UUID is already present in the catalog, you will receive an error message.</li> <li>Overwrite metadata with same UUID - any existing metadata record in the catalog with the same UUID as the record you are loading will be replaced with the metadata record you are loading.</li> <li>Generate UUID for inserted metadata - create new a UUID for the metadata records you are loading.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Stylesheet - Allows you to transform the metadata record using an XSLT stylesheet before loading the record. The drop down control is filled with the names of files taken from the INSTALL_DIR/web/geonetwork/xsl/conversion/import folder. (Files can be added to this folder without restarting GeoNetwork). As an example, you could use this option to convert a metadata into schema that is supported by GeoNetwork.</p> </li> <li>Validate - The metadata is validated against its schema before loading. If it is not valid it will not be loaded.</li> <li>Group - Use this option to select a user group to assign to the imported metadata.</li> <li>Category - Use this option to select a local category to assign to the imported metadata. Categories are local to the catalogue you are using and are intended to provide a simple way of searching groups of metadata records.</li> </ul> <p>At the bottom of the page there are two buttons:</p> <ul> <li>Back Goes back to the administration form.</li> <li>Upload Starts the import process.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"users/managing_metadata/import/#notes-on-the-batch-import-process","title":"Notes on the batch import process","text":"<ul> <li>When the import process ends, the total count of imported metadata will be shown</li> <li>The import is transactional: the metadata set will be fully imported or fully discarded (there are no partial imports)</li> <li>Files that start with '.' or that do not end with '.xml' or '.mef' are ignored</li> </ul>"},{"location":"users/managing_metadata/import/#structured-batch-import-using-import-configxml","title":"Structured batch import using import-config.xml","text":"<p>Finer control of the batch import process can be obtained by structuring the metadata files into directories mapped to categories and metadata schemas and describing the mapping in a file called import-config.xml.</p> <p>The import-config.xml should be placed in the directory from which you will batch import (see Directory parameter above).

The prototype was built on experiences within and outside the organisation. It used metadata content available from legacy systems that was transformed into what was then only a draft metadata standard, the ISO 19115. Later on, another UN agency, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the project and with its contribution the first version of the software was released in 2003 and operational catalogues were established in FAO and WFP. The system was based on the ISO19115:DIS metadata standard and embedded the Web Map Client InterMap that supported Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant Web Map Services. Distributed searches were possible using the standard Z39.50 catalogue protocol. At that moment it was decided to develop the program as a Free and Open Source Software to allow the whole geospatial users community to benefit from the development results and to contribute to the further advancement of the software.</p> <p>Jointly with the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), FAO developed a second version in 2004. The new release allowed users to work with multiple metadata standards (ISO 19115, FGDC and Dublin Core) in a transparent manner. It also allowed metadata to be shared between catalogues through a caching mechanism, improving reliability when searching in multiple catalogues.</p> <p>In 2006, the GeoNetwork team dedicated efforts to develop a DVD containing the GeoNetwork version 2.0.3 and the best free and open source software in the field of Geoinformatics. The DVD was produced and distributed in hard copy to over three thousand people. More recently, the OSGeo Live project has been developed with GeoNetwork and all the best Open Source Geospatial software available on a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Xubuntu. The GeoNetwork community has been a part of this project and will continue to make sure the latest stable version of GeoNetwork is included. You can download the OSGeo-Live images from OSGeo Live website.</p> <p>GeoNetwork opensource is the result of the collaborative development of many contributors. These include among others the Food and Agriculture organisation (FAO), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CSI-CGIAR), The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), The European Space Agency (ESA) and many others. Support for the metadata standard ISO19115:2003 has been added by using the ISO19139:2007 implementation specification schema published in May 2007. The release also serves as the open source reference implementation of the OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW 2.0.2) specification.

At present, the user and developer mailing lists count well over 250 subscriptions each. Subscription to these lists is open to anyone interested. The archive of the mailing lists provides an important resource for users and can be freely browsed online. Members provide feedback within the community and provide translations, new functionalities, bug reports, fixes and instructions to the project as a whole. Building a self sustaining community of users and developers is one of the biggest challenges for the project. This community-building process relies on active participation and interaction of its members. It also relies on building trust and operating in a transparent manner, thereby agreeing on the overall objectives, prioritization and long term direction of the project.

One focuses on the users of the software (http://geonetwork-opensource.org), while the other one is dedicated to the developers (http://trac.osgeo.org/geonetwork). Both can be updated and maintained online by trusted members of the community. They provide documentation, bug reporting and tracking, Wiki pages et cetera. A small part of the community connects through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) on a public <code>irc://irc.freenode.net/geonetwork</code> channel. But most interaction takes place on the user and the developer mailing lists.</p> <p>During the 2006 workshop, the Project Advisory Board decided to propose the GeoNetwork opensource project as an incubator project to the newly founded Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). This incubation process was successfully completed and the project websites were moved to servers accessible under the umbrella of the OSGeo foundation.</p> <p>Source code is maintained in a publicly accessible code repository, hosted at an independent service provider, github.com that hosts thousands of FOSS projects. Developers and users have full access to all sections of the source code, while trusted developers can make changes in the repository itself. A special mailing list has been established to monitor changes in the code repository.

A selection of the main fields from different categories of information is shown in one single view. The minimum set of metadata required to serve the full range of metadata applications (data discovery, determination of data fitness for use, data access, data transfer and use of digital data) is defined here, along with optional metadata elements to allow for a more extensive standard description of geographic data, if required. However, if should be there a need to add more metadata elements, you can switch to the advanced view at any time while editing.</p> <p>In the Advanced View, the ISO profile offers the possibility to visualize and edit the entire metadata structure organized in sections accessible through tabs from the left column.

The meaning of mandatory and optional is fairly intuitive; the mandatory fields are required, like <code>Title</code> and <code>Abstract</code> for instance, whereas the optional fields can be provided but are not fundamental, depending on the metadata author. The conditional fields may be considered mandatory under certain circumstances: essentially a conditional requirement indicates that the presence of a specified data element is dependent on the value or presence of other data elements in the same section. For instance, the <code>Individual name</code> metadata element of the <code>Point of Contact</code>, which is a conditional element of the Identification section, becomes mandatory if another element of the same section, <code>Organization name</code> or <code>Position name</code> is not already defined.</p> <p> Point of Contact</p> <p>The mandatory fields as well as those highly recommended are flagged with red asterisk [*].
