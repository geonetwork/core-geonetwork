        <!-- Additional CSW entry points can be defined with a filter condition which applies extra criteria
            to the CSW request. The filter condition should be defined using Lucene query syntax
            ( http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html).

            Defining a new CSW entry point requires a GeoNetwork restart

            Some examples:

            <service name="csw-custom">
            <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
                   <param name="filter" value="+inspirerelated:on"/>
                </class>
            </service>

            <service name="csw-custom2">
            <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
                   <param name="filter" value="+inspirerelated:on +keyword:Elevation"/>
                </class>
            </service>

        -->
        <service name="csw-integration-test">
            <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher">
                <param name="filter" value="+spatialRepresentationType:vector"/>
            </class>
        </service>
