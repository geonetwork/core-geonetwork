    <!-- Additional CSW entry points can be defined with a filter condition which applies extra criteria
        to the CSW request. The filter condition should be defined using Lucene query syntax
        ( http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html).

        Defining a new CSW entry point requires a GeoNetwork restart

        Some examples:

        <service name="csw-custom">
        <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
               <param name="filter" value="+inspirerelated:on"/>
            </class>
        </service>

        <service name="csw-custom2">
        <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
               <param name="filter" value="+inspirerelated:on +keyword:Elevation"/>
            </class>
        </service>

    <service name="csw-integration-test">
      <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher">
        <param name="filter" value="+spatialRepresentationType:vector"/>
