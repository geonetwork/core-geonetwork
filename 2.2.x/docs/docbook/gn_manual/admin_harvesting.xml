        <section>
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>Since the beginning of the project, there has been the need to share metadata
                among several GeoNetwork nodes. Usually, each node takes care of a region of
                interest so it is important to be able to perform a search over all these nodes at
                the same time. This is called distributed search and exploits the Internet
                connectivity. In our cases, this distributed search can be heavy to perform if there
                are many maps with associated thumbnails. Furthermore, GeoNetwork is usually
                employed in countries (like Africa, Brazil) where the connectivity is bad, making
                the use of distributed search not feasible.</para>
            <para>The harvesting is the process of collecting remote metadata and storing them
                locally for a faster access. This is a periodic process to do, for example, once a
                week. Harvesting is not a simple import: local and remote metadata are kept aligned.
                Using some <emphasis>magic</emphasis>, GeoNetwork is capable of discovering metadata
                that have been added, removed or updated.</para>
            <para>GeoNetwork is able to harvest from the following sources (for more details see
                below):</para>

        <section>
            <title>Mechanism overview</title>
            <para>The harvesting mechanism is based on the concept of <emphasis>universally</emphasis>
                <emphasis>unique</emphasis>
                <emphasis>identifier</emphasis> (uuid). This is a special id because it is not only
                unique locally to the node that generated it but it is unique across all the world.
                It is a combination of the network interface’s MAC address, the current date/time
                and a random number. Every time you create a new metadata in GeoNetwork, a new uuid
                is generated and assigned to it.</para>
            <para>Another important concept behind the harvesting is the <emphasis>last</emphasis>
                <emphasis>change</emphasis>
                <emphasis>date</emphasis>. Every time you change a metadata, its last change date is
                updated. Just storing this parameter and comparing it with a new one allows any
                system to find out if the metadata has been modified since last update.</para>
            <para>These two concepts allow GeoNetwork to fetch a remote metadata, check if it has
                been updated and remove it locally if it has been removed remotely. Furthermore,
                thanks to uuids, a hierarchy of harvesting nodes can be built where B harvests from
                C and A harvests from B. Even loops can be created because harvested metadata cannot
                be modified.</para>

            <title>Harvesting lifecycle</title>
            <para>When a harvesting node is set, there is no harvested metadata. During the first
                run, all remote matching metadata are retrieved and stored locally. After the first
                run, only changed metadata are retrieved. Harvested metadata are not editable for
                the following reasons:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The harvesting is periodic so any local change to harvested metadata will
                        be lost during the next run.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The change date is used to keep track of changes so if it gets changed
                        outside the originator site, the harvesting mechanism is compromised.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>Beside the metadata itself, this implies that users cannot change all other
                metadata properties (like categories, privileges etc...).</para>
            <para>The harvesting process goes on until one of the following situations arises:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An administrator stops (deactivates) the node.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An exception arises. In this case the node is automatically
                    stopped.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>When a harvesting node is removed, all harvest metadata are removed too.</para>

        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Multiple harvesting and hierarchies</title>
            <para>Catalogues that provide uuids for metadata (for example GeoNetwork and a CSW
                server) can be harvested several times without having to take care about metadata
                overlap. This allows the possibility to perform a thematic search and a metadata
                belonging to multiple searches is harvested only once and not duplicated.</para>
            <para>This mechanism allows the GeoNetwork harvesting type to be combined with other
                GeoNetwork nodes to perform hierarchical harvesting. This way a metadata can be
                harvested from several nodes. For example, consider this scenario:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (A) has created metadata (a)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (B) harvests (a) from (A)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (C) harvests (a) from (B)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (D) harvests from both (A), (B) and (C)</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>In this scenario, Node (D) will get the same metadata (a) from all 3 nodes (A),
                (B), (C). The metadata will flow to (D) following 3 different paths but thanks to
                its uuid only one copy will be stored. When (a) will be changed in (A), a new
                version will flow to (D) but, thanks to the change date, the copy in (D) will be
                updated with the most recent version.</para>

            <para><xref linkend="admin_harvesting_list"/> shows the harvesting main page. The page
                shows a list of harvesting nodes that have been created so far. On the bottom side
                there is a set of buttons to manage these nodes. The meaning of each column is as
                follows:</para>
            <para>Select This is just a checkbox to select one or more nodes. The selected nodes
                will be affected by the first row of buttons (start, stop, run, remove). For
                example, if you select 3 nodes and press the Remove button, these 3 nodes will be
                removed. Name This is the node’s name provided by the administrator. Type The node’s
                harvesting type choosed when the node was created (geonetwork, web folder etc...).
                Status This is an icon that reflects the node’s current status. See <xref
                    linkend="admin_harvesting_status"/> for all different icons and status
                description. Errors This column reflects the status of the last harvesting run,
                which could have succeeded or not. The result is reflected on this icon and a
                tooltip will show detailed information. See <xref
                    linkend="admin_harvesting_status_2"/> for all different icons. Every Time (in
                days, hours, minutes) between two consecutive harvesting from this node. Last run
                The date, in ISO 8601 format, of the most recent harvesting run. Operation A list of
                buttons for all possible operations on a node. At least, an Edit button is present.
                Pressing this button you will reach the same page used to create the node. From this
                page you can change the desired parameters.</para>

            <para>The bottom side of the page contains two rows of buttons. The first row contains
                buttons that can operate on a set of nodes. You can select the nodes using the
                checkbox on the first column and then press the proper button. When the button
                finishes its action, the checkboxes are cleared. The second row contains general
                purpose buttons. Here is the meaning of each button:</para>
            <para>Activate When a new harvesting node is created, it’s status is
                <emphasis>inactive</emphasis>. Use this button to make it
                <emphasis>active</emphasis> and thus to start harvesting from the remote node.
                Deactivate Stops harvesting from a node. Please notice that this does not mean that
                a currently running harvesting will be stopped but it means that this node will be
                ignored during future harvestings. Run This button simply tells the harvesting
                engine to start harvesting immediately. This is usefull for testing during the
                harvesting setup. Remove Remove all currently selected nodes. A dialog will ask the
                user to confirm the action. Back Simply returns to the main administration page. Add
                This button allows to create new harvesting nodes. See section ?? for more
                information. Refresh Refreshes the current list of nodes quering the server. This
                can be usefull to see if the harvesting list has been altered by someone else or if
                any harvesting process started.</para>

                <para>If the harvesting succeeds, a tooltip will show detailed information about the
                    harvesting process. This way you can check if the harvester worked as expected
                    or if there is something to fix to the harvesting parameters or somewhere else.
                    The result tip is like a table, where each row refers to</para>
                <para>Total This is the total number of metadata found remotely. Metadata with the
                    same id are considered as one. Added Number of metadata added to the system
                    because they were not present locally. Removed Number of metadata that have been
                    removed locally because they are not present in the remote server anymore.
                    Updated Number of metadata that are present locally but that needed to be
                    updated because their last change date was different from the remote one.
                    Unchanged Local metadata left unchanged. Their remote last change date did not
                    change. Unknown schema Number of skipped metadata because their format was not
                    recognized by GeoNetwork. Unretrievable Number of metadata that were ready to be
                    retrieved from the remote server but for some reason there was an exception
                    during the data transfer process. Bad Format Number of skipped metadata because
                    they did not have a valid XML representation. Does not validate Number of
                    metadata which did not validate against their schema. These metadata were
                    harvestable with success but skipped due to the validation process. Usually,
                    there is an option to force validation: if you want to harvest these metadata
                    anyway, simply turn it off.</para>

            <title>Adding new nodes</title>
            <para>The Add button in the main page allows you to add new harvesting nodes. After
                pressing it, you will reach the page shown in <xref linkend="admin_harvesting_add"
                />. When creating a new node, you have to choose the harvesting protocol implemented
                by the remote server. The supported protocols are:</para>
            <para>Geonetwork This is the standard and most powerfull harvesting protocol used in
                GeoNetwork. It is able to log in into the remote node, to perform a standard search
                using the common queryable fields and to import all matching metadata. Furthermore,
                the protocol will try to keep both remote privileges and categories of the harvested
                metadata if they exist locally. Please notice that since GeoNetwork 2.1 the
                harvesting protocol has been improved. This means that it is not possible to use
                this protocol to harvest from version 2.0 or below. Web DAV This harvesting type
                uses the web DAV (Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol to harvest metadata
                from a DAV server. It can be useful to users that want to publish their metadata
                through a web server that offers a DAV interface. The protocol allows to retrieve
                the contents of a web page (a list of files) with their change date. CSW CSW stands
                for <emphasis>Catalogue Services for the Web</emphasis> and it is a search interface
                for catalogues developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium. GeoNetwork is compatible
                with version 2.0.1 of such protocol. Old geonetwork GeoNetwork 2.1 introduced a new
                powerfull harvesting engine which is not compatible with the old one present in
                GeoNetwork 2.0. Old 2.0 servers can still harvest from 2.1 servers but a 2.1 server
                needs this harvesting type to harvest from old 2.0 servers. This harvesting type is
                deprecated and only kept until GeoNetwork 2.1 will be widely spread. OAI-PMH The
                acronym stands for <emphasis>Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata
                    Harvesting</emphasis>. It is a good harvesting protol widely used. GeoNetwork is
                compatible with version 2.0 of the protocol.</para>
            <para>The drop down list shows all available protocols. Pressing the Add button you will
                reach an edit page whose content depends on the choosed protocol. The Back button
                will go back to the main page.</para>

                <title>Adding a GeoNetwork node</title>
                <para>This type of harvesting allows you to connect to a GeoNetwork node, perform a
                    simple search as in the main page and retrieve all matched metadata. The search
                    is usefull because it allows you to focus only on metadata of interest. Once you
                    add a node of this type, you will get a page like the one shown in <xref
                        linkend="admin_harvesting_gn"/>. The meaning of the options is the
                    following:</para>

                <para>Site Here you put information about the GeoNetwork’s node you want to harvest
                    from (host, port and servlet). If you want to search protected metadata you have
                    to specify an account. The name parameter is just a short description that will
                    be shown in the main page beside each node. Search In this section you can
                    specify search parameters: they are the same present in the main page. Before
                    doing that, it is important to remember that the GeoNetwork’s harvesting can be
                    hierarchical so a remote node can contain both its metadata and metadata
                    harvested from other nodes and sources. At the beginning, the Source drop down
                    is empty and you have to use the Retrieve sources button to fill it. The purpose
                    of this button is to query GeoNetwork about all sources which it is currently
                    harvesting from. Once you get the drop down filled, you can choose a source name
                    to constrain the search to that source only. Leaving the drop down blank, the
                    search will spread over all metadata (harvested and not). You can add several
                    search criteria for each site through the Add button: several searches will be
                    performed and results merged. Each search box can be removed pressing the small
                    button on the left of the site’s name. If no search criteria is added, a global
                    unconstrained search will be performed. Options This is just a container for
                    general options.</para>

                    harvesting will do only one run after which it will become inactive. Privileges
                    Here you decide how to map remote group’s privileges. You can assign a copy
                    policy to each group. The Intranet group is not considered because it does not
                    make sense to copy its privileges. The All group has different policies from all
                    the others:</para>

                <para>Site All options are the same as web DAV harvesting. The only difference is
                    that the URL parameter here points to an OAI-PMH server. This is the entry point
                    that GeoNetwork will use to issue all PMH commands. Search This part allows you
                    to restrict the harvesting to specific metadata subsets. You can specify several
                    searches: GeoNetwork will execute them sequentially and results will be merged
                    to avoid the harvesting of the same metadata. Several searches allow you to
                    specify different search criteria. In each search, you can specify the following
                    parameters:</para>
                <para>From You can provide a start date here. All metadata whose last change date is
                    equal to or greater than this date will be harvested. You cannot simply edit
                    this field but you have to use the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="images/icons/calendar.gif"/> icon to popup a calendar and choose
                    the date. This field is optional so if you don’t provide it the start date
                    constraint is dropped. Use the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="images/icons/clear_left.png"/> icon to clear the field. Until Works
                    exactly as the from parameter but adds an end constraint to the last change
                    date. The until date is included in the date range, the check is: less than or
                    equal to. Set An OAI-PMH server classifies its metadata into hierarchical sets.
                    You can request to return metadata that belong to only one set (and its
                    subsets). This narrows the search result. Initially the drop down shows only a
                    blank option that indicate <emphasis>no set</emphasis>. After specifying the
                    connection URL, you can press the Retrieve Info button, whose purpose is to
                    connect to the remote node, retrieve all supported sets and prefixes and fill
                    the search drop downs. After you have pressed this button, you can select a
                    remote set from the drop down. Prefix Here prefix means metadata format. The
                    oai_dc prefix is mandatory for any OAI-PMH compliant server, so this entry is
                    always present into the prefix drop down. To have this drop down filled with all
                    prefixes supported by the remote server, you have to enter a valid URL and press
                    the Retrieve Info button.</para>
                <para>You can use the Add button to add one more search to the list. A search can be
                    removed clicking the <inlinegraphic fileref="images/icons/fileclose.png"/> icon
                    on its left. Options Most options are common to web DAV harvesting. The validate
                    option, when checked, will validate each harvested metadata against GeoNetwork’s
                    schemas. Only valid metadata will be harvested. Invalid one will be skipped.

                <para>At the bottom of the page there are the following buttons:</para>
                <para>Back Go back to the main harvesting page. The harvesting is not added. Save
                    Saves node’s data creating a new harvesting node. Then it will go back to the
                    main harvesting page.</para>
                <para>Please note that when you edit a previously created node, both the
                        <emphasis>set</emphasis> and <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> drop down lists
                    will be empty. They will contain only the previously selected entries, plus the
                    default ones if they were not selected. Furthermore, the set name will not be
                    localized but the internal code string will be displayed. You have to press the
                    retrieve info button again to connect to the remote server and retrieve the
                    localized name and all set and prefix information.</para>
