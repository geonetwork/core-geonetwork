.. class:: LayerNode(config)

    A subclass of ``Ext.tree.TreeNode`` that is connected to an
    ``OpenLayers.Layer`` by setting the node's layer property. Checking or
    unchecking the checkbox of this node will directly affect the layer and
    vice versa. The default iconCls for this node's icon is
    "gx-tree-layer-icon", unless it has children.

    Setting the node's layer property to a layer name instead of an object
    will also work. As soon as a layer is found, it will be stored as layer
    property in the attributes hash.

    The node's text property defaults to the layer name.

    If the node has a checkedGroup attribute configured, it will be
    rendered with a radio button instead of the checkbox. The value of
    the checkedGroup attribute is a string, identifying the options group
    for the node.

    To use this node type in a ``TreePanel`` config, set ``nodeType`` to
    "gx_layer".


    


Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.tree.TreeNode <http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.tree.TreeNode>`_.


.. describe:: layer

    ``OpenLayers.Layer or String``
    The layer that this layer node will
    be bound to, or the name of the layer (has to match the layer's
    name property). If a layer name is provided, ``layerStore`` also has
    to be provided.

.. describe:: layerStore

    :class:`GeoExt.data.LayerStore` ``or "auto"``
    The layer store containing the layer that this node represents.  If set
    to "auto", the node will query the ComponentManager for a
    :class:`GeoExt.MapPanel`, take the first one it finds and take its layer
    store. This property is only required if ``layer`` is provided as a
    string.

.. describe:: loader

    ``Ext.tree.TreeLoader|Object`` If provided, subnodes will be added to
    this LayerNode. Obviously, only loaders that process an
    ``OpenLayers.Layer`` or :class:`GeoExt.data.LayerRecord` (like
    :class:`GeoExt.tree.LayerParamsLoader`) will actually generate child
    nodes here. If provided as ``Object``, a
    :class:`GeoExt.tree.LayerParamLoader` instance will be created, with
    the provided object as configuration.
