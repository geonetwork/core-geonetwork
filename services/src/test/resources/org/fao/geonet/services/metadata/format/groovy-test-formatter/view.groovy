 * - f - an org.fao.geonet.services.metadata.format.groovy.Functions object
 * - env - an org.fao.geonet.services.metadata.format.groovy.Environment object.

 *                     object is created but not executed.  The transformer is cached so that the

 * function/closer will be executed passing in the selected element
 * as mentioned above a handle function can return a string, file or XML
 * in the case below it returns a string which will be parsed into XML

 *
 * exact name have a default priority of 1 where as matchers that use functions to do the matching have a priority of 0
 * the matchers are checked to see if they are applied first by priority and then in the order that they are defined.
 *
 * The parameters passed to the handler are:
 * - the GPathResult representing the current node
 * - the current TransformationContext.  This contains information about the current state of the transformation.  it is not
 *   normally of use in the closures.
 *
 * Like Javascript you only need to specify as many parameters as needed.

 * The return value will be converted to a string via the toString method and that string will be added to the resulting xml/html
