## Forks, Pull requests and branches

If you want to contribute back to GeoNetwork you create a Github account, fork the GeoNetwork repository and work on your fork. This is a huge benefit because you can push your changes to your repository as much as you want and when a feature is complete you can make a 'Pull Request'.  Pull requests are the recommended method of contributing back to GeoNetwork because Github has code review tools and merges are much easier than trying to apply a patch attached to a ticket.

The GeoNetwork Repository is at: https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork.

Follow the instructions on the Github website to get started (make accounts, how to fork etc...) 

* http://help.github.com/

If you cloned the GeoNetwork Repository earlier, you set you can now set your fork up as a remote and begin to work.

Rename the GeoNetwork repository as ``upstream``:

     git remote rename origin upstream

Add your fork as origin (the URL provided by GitHub CLONE or DOWNLOAD button):

     git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/core-geonetwork.git

List remotes showing ``origin`` and ``upstream``:

     git remote -v
     
To checkout a branch from upstream::

     git checkout -t upstream/3.6.x
