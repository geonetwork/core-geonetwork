GeoNetwork use submodules, these were initiziled by the ``--recursive`` option when cloning the repository.

```
cd core-geonetwork
git submodule init

Submodules are used to keep track of externals dependencies. It is necessary to init and update them after a branch change:


```
  git submodule update --init
```

Remember to rebuild the application after updating external dependencies.
